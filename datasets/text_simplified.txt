Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket I seated 
 myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see 
 Queequeg near me Affected by the solemnity of the scene there was 
 a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance This 
 savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance 
 because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was 
 not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall Whether any of 
 the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among 
 the congregation I knew not but so many are the unrecorded 
 accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present 
 wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief 
 that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose 
 unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically 
 caused the old wounds to bleed afresh 
 
 Oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing 
 among flowers can say here HERE lies my beloved ye know not the 
 desolation that broods in bosoms like these What bitter blanks in 
 those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes What despair in 
 those immovable inscriptions What deadly voids and unbidden 
 infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith and 
 refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished 
 without a grave As well might those tablets stand in the cave of 
 Elephanta as here 
 
 In what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included 
 why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no 
 tales though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands how it 
 is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we 
 prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle 
 him if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth 
 why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon 
 immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly 
 hopeless trance yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries 
 ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we 
 nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the 
 living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a 
 knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city All these things are 
 not without their meanings 
 
 But Faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these 
 dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope 
 
 It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a 
 Nantucket voyage I regarded those marble tablets and by the murky 
 light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who 
 had gone before me Yes Ishmael the same fate may be thine But 
 somehow I grew merry again Delightful inducements to embark fine 
 chance for promotion it seems - aye a stove boat will make me an 
 immortal by brevet Yes there is death in this business of 
 whaling - a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into 
 Eternity But what then Methinks we have hugely mistaken this 
 matter of Life and Death Methinks that what they call my shadow 
 here on earth is my true substance Methinks that in looking at 
 things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun 
 through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air 
 Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being In fact take 
 my body who will take it I say it is not me And therefore three 
 cheers for Nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they 
 will for stave my soul Jove himself cannot
