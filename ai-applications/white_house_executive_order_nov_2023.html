<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Section 1.&nbsp; Purpose.&nbsp; Artificial intelligence (AI) holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril.&nbsp; Responsible AI use has the potential to help solve urgent challenges while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure.&nbsp; At the same time, irresponsible use could exacerbate societal harms such as fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation; displace and disempower workers; stifle competition; and pose risks to national security.&nbsp; Harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks.&nbsp; This endeavor demands a society-wide effort that includes government, the private sector, academia, and civil society.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My Administration places the highest urgency on governing the development and use of AI safely and responsibly, and is therefore advancing a coordinated, Federal Government-wide approach to doing so. &nbsp;The rapid speed at which AI capabilities are advancing compels the United States to lead in this moment for the sake of our security, economy, and society.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, AI reflects the principles of the people who build it, the people who use it, and the data upon which it is built.&nbsp; I firmly believe that the power of our ideals; the foundations of our society; and the creativity, diversity, and decency of our people are the reasons that America thrived in past eras of rapid change.&nbsp; They are the reasons we will succeed again in this moment.&nbsp; We are more than capable of harnessing AI for justice, security, and opportunity for all.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sec. 2.&nbsp; Policy and Principles.&nbsp; It is the policy of my Administration to advance and govern the development and use of AI in accordance with eight guiding principles and priorities.&nbsp; When undertaking the actions set forth in this order, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adhere to these principles, while, as feasible, taking into account the views of other agencies, industry, members of academia, civil society, labor unions, international allies and partners, and other relevant organizations:</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence must be safe and secure.&nbsp; Meeting this goal requires robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized evaluations of AI systems, as well as policies, institutions, and, as appropriate, other mechanisms to test, understand, and mitigate risks from these systems before they are put to use.&nbsp; It also requires addressing AI systems&#8217; most pressing security risks &#8212; including with respect to biotechnology, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, and other national security dangers &#8212; while navigating AI&#8217;s opacity and complexity.&nbsp; Testing and evaluations, including post-deployment performance monitoring, will help ensure that AI systems function as intended, are resilient against misuse or dangerous modifications, are ethically developed and operated in a secure manner, and are compliant with applicable Federal laws and policies.&nbsp; Finally, my Administration will help develop effective labeling and content provenance mechanisms, so that Americans are able to determine when content is generated using AI and when it is not.&nbsp; These actions will provide a vital foundation for an approach that addresses AI&#8217;s risks without unduly reducing its benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Promoting responsible innovation, competition, and collaboration will allow the United States to lead in AI and unlock the technology&#8217;s potential to solve some of society&#8217;s most difficult challenges.&nbsp; This effort requires investments in AI-related education, training, development, research, and capacity, while simultaneously tackling novel intellectual property (IP) questions and other problems to protect inventors and creators.&nbsp; Across the Federal Government, my Administration will support programs to provide Americans the skills they need for the age of AI and attract the world&#8217;s AI talent to our shores &#8212; not just to study, but to stay &#8212; so that the companies and technologies of the future are made in America.&nbsp; The Federal Government will promote a fair, open, and competitive ecosystem and marketplace for AI and related technologies so that small developers and entrepreneurs can continue to drive innovation.&nbsp; Doing so requires stopping unlawful collusion and addressing risks from dominant firms&#8217; use of key assets such as semiconductors, computing power, cloud storage, and data to disadvantage competitors, and it requires supporting a marketplace that harnesses the benefits of AI to provide new opportunities for small businesses, workers, and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp; The responsible development and use of AI require a commitment to supporting American workers.&nbsp; As AI creates new jobs and industries, all workers need a seat at the table, including through collective bargaining, to ensure that they benefit from these opportunities.&nbsp; My Administration will seek to adapt job training and education to support a diverse workforce and help provide access to opportunities that AI creates.&nbsp; In the workplace itself, AI should not be deployed in ways that undermine rights, worsen job quality, encourage undue worker surveillance, lessen market competition, introduce new health and safety risks, or cause harmful labor-force disruptions.&nbsp; The critical next steps in AI development should be built on the views of workers, labor unions, educators, and employers to support responsible uses of AI that improve workers&#8217; lives, positively augment human work, and help all people safely enjoy the gains and opportunities from technological innovation.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d)&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence policies must be consistent with my Administration&#8217;s dedication to advancing equity and civil rights.&nbsp; My Administration cannot &#8212; and will not &#8212; tolerate the use of AI to disadvantage those who are already too often denied equal opportunity and justice.&nbsp; From hiring to housing to healthcare, we have seen what happens when AI use deepens discrimination and bias, rather than improving quality of life.&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence systems deployed irresponsibly have reproduced and intensified existing inequities, caused new types of harmful discrimination, and exacerbated online and physical harms.&nbsp; My Administration will build on the important steps that have already been taken &#8212; such as issuing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, the AI Risk Management Framework, and Executive Order 14091 of February 16, 2023 (Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government) &#8212; in seeking to ensure that AI complies with all Federal laws and to promote robust technical evaluations, careful oversight, engagement with affected communities, and rigorous regulation.&nbsp; It is necessary to hold those developing and deploying AI accountable to standards that protect against unlawful discrimination and abuse, including in the justice system and the Federal Government.&nbsp; Only then can Americans trust AI to advance civil rights, civil liberties, equity, and justice for all.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(e)&nbsp; The interests of Americans who increasingly use, interact with, or purchase AI and AI-enabled products in their daily lives must be protected.&nbsp; Use of new technologies, such as AI, does not excuse organizations from their legal obligations, and hard-won consumer protections are more important than ever in moments of technological change.&nbsp; The Federal Government will enforce existing consumer protection laws and principles and enact appropriate safeguards against fraud, unintended bias, discrimination, infringements on privacy, and other harms from AI.&nbsp; Such protections are especially important in critical fields like healthcare, financial services, education, housing, law, and transportation, where mistakes by or misuse of AI could harm patients, cost consumers or small businesses, or jeopardize safety or rights.&nbsp; At the same time, my Administration will promote responsible uses of AI that protect consumers, raise the quality of goods and services, lower their prices, or expand selection and availability.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(f)&nbsp; Americans&#8217; privacy and civil liberties must be protected as AI continues advancing.&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence is making it easier to extract, re-identify, link, infer, and act on sensitive information about people&#8217;s identities, locations, habits, and desires.&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence&#8217;s capabilities in these areas can increase the risk that personal data could be exploited and exposed.&nbsp; To combat this risk, the Federal Government will ensure that the collection, use, and retention of data is lawful, is secure, and mitigates privacy and confidentiality risks.&nbsp; Agencies shall use available policy and technical tools, including privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) where appropriate, to protect privacy and to combat the broader legal and societal risks &#8212; including the chilling of First Amendment rights &#8212; that result from the improper collection and use of people&#8217;s data.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(g)&nbsp; It is important to manage the risks from the Federal Government&#8217;s own use of AI and increase its internal capacity to regulate, govern, and support responsible use of AI to deliver better results for Americans.&nbsp; These efforts start with people, our Nation&#8217;s greatest asset.&nbsp; My Administration will take steps to attract, retain, and develop public service-oriented AI professionals, including from underserved communities, across&nbsp;disciplines &#8212; including technology, policy, managerial,&nbsp;procurement, regulatory, ethical, governance, and legal fields &#8212; and ease AI professionals&#8217; path into the Federal Government to help harness and govern AI.&nbsp; The Federal Government will work to ensure that all members of its workforce receive adequate training to understand the benefits, risks, and limitations of AI for their job functions, and to modernize Federal Government information technology infrastructure, remove&nbsp;bureaucratic obstacles, and ensure that safe and rights-respecting AI is adopted, deployed, and used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(h)&nbsp; The Federal Government should lead the way to global societal, economic, and technological progress, as the United&nbsp;States has in previous eras of disruptive innovation and change.&nbsp; This leadership is not measured solely by the technological advancements our country makes.&nbsp; Effective leadership also means pioneering those systems and safeguards needed to deploy technology responsibly &#8212; and building and promoting those safeguards with the rest of the world. &nbsp;My Administration will engage with international allies and partners in developing a framework to manage AI&#8217;s risks, unlock AI&#8217;s potential for good, and promote common approaches to shared challenges.&nbsp; The Federal Government will seek to promote responsible AI safety and security principles and actions with other nations, including our competitors, while leading key global conversations and collaborations to ensure that AI benefits the whole world, rather than exacerbating inequities, threatening human rights, and causing other harms.&nbsp;</p>
