in the branch of mathemat known as real analysi the riemann integr creat by bernhard riemann wa the first rigor definit of the integr of a function on an interv it wa present to the faculti at the univers of göttingen in 1854 but not publish in a journal until 1868 for mani function and practic applic the riemann integr can be evalu by the fundament theorem of calculu or approxim by numer integr the riemann integr is unsuit for mani theoret purpos some of the technic defici in riemann integr can be remedi with the riemann–stieltj integr and most disappear with the lebesgu integr let f be a nonneg real -valu function on the interv a b and let be the region of the plane under the graph of the function f and abov the interv a b see the figur on the top right we are interest in measur the area of s onc we have measur it we will denot the area by the basic idea of the riemann integr is to use veri simpl approxim for the area of s by take better and better approxim we can say that `` in the limit '' we get exactli the area of s under the curv note that where f can be both posit and neg the definit of s is modifi so that the integr correspond to the sign area under the graph of f that is the area abov the x -axi minu the area below the x -axi a partit of an interv a b is a finit sequenc of number of the form each x i x i 1 is call a subinterv of the partit the mesh or norm of a partit is defin to be the length of the longest subinterv that is a tag partit p x t of an interv a b is a partit togeth with a finit sequenc of number t 0 ... t n − 1 subject to the condit that for each i t i ∈ x i x i 1 in other word it is a partit togeth with a distinguish point of everi subinterv the mesh of a tag partit is the same as that of an ordinari partit suppos that two partit p x t and q y s are both partit of the interv a b we say that q y s is a refin of p x t if for each integ i with i ∈ 0 n there exist an integ r i such that x i y r i and such that t i s j for some j with j ∈ r i r i 1 said more simpli a refin of a tag partit break up some of the subinterv and add tag to the partit where necessari thu it `` refin '' the accuraci of the partit we can defin a partial order on the set of all tag partit by say that one tag partit is greater or equal to anoth if the former is a refin of the latter let f be a real-valu function defin on the interv a b the riemann sum of f with respect to the tag partit x 0 ... x n togeth with t 0 ... t n − 1 is each term in the sum is the product of the valu of the function at a given point and the length of an interv consequ each term repres the sign area of a rectangl with height f t i and width x i 1 − x i the riemann sum is the sign area of all the rectangl a close relat concept are the lower and upper darboux sum these are similar to riemann sum but the tag are replac by the infimum and supremum respect of f on each subinterv if f is continu then the lower and upper darboux sum for an untag partit are equal to the riemann sum for that partit where the tag are chosen to be the minimum or maximum respect of f on each subinterv when f is discontinu on a subinterv there may not be a tag that achiev the infimum or supremum on that subinterv the darboux integr which is similar to the riemann integr but base on darboux sum is equival to the riemann integr loos speak the riemann integr is the limit of the riemann sum of a function as the partit get finer if the limit exist then the function is said to be integr or more specif riemann-integr the riemann sum can be made as close as desir to the riemann integr by make the partit fine enough one import requir is that the mesh of the partit must becom smaller and smaller so that in the limit it is zero if thi were not so then we would not be get a good approxim to the function on certain subinterv in fact thi is enough to defin an integr to be specif we say that the riemann integr of f equal s if the follow condit hold for all ε gt 0 there exist δ such that for ani tag partit x 0 ... x n and t 0 ... t n − 1 whose mesh is less than δ we have unfortun thi definit is veri difficult to use it would help to develop an equival definit of the riemann integr which is easier to work with we develop thi definit now with a proof of equival follow our new definit say that the riemann integr of f equal s if the follow condit hold for all ε gt 0 there exist a tag partit y 0 ... y m and r 0 ... r m − 1 such that for ani tag partit x 0 ... x n and t 0 ... t n − 1 which is a refin of y 0 ... y m and r 0 ... r m − 1 we have both of these mean that eventu the riemann sum of f with respect to ani partit get trap close to s sinc thi is true no matter how close we demand the sum be trap we say that the riemann sum converg to s these definit are actual a special case of a more gener concept a net as we state earlier these two definit are equival in other word s work in the first definit if and onli if s work in the second definit to show that the first definit impli the second start with an ε and choos a δ that satisfi the condit choos ani tag partit whose mesh is less than δ it riemann sum is within ε of s and ani refin of thi partit will also have mesh less than δ so the riemann sum of the refin will also be within ε of s to show that the second definit impli the first it is easiest to use the darboux integr first one show that the second definit is equival to the definit of the darboux integr for thi see the articl on darboux integr now we will show that a darboux integr function satisfi the first definit fix ε and choos a partit y 0 ... y m such that the lower and upper darboux sum with respect to thi partit are within ε /2 of the valu s of the darboux integr let if r 0 then f is the zero function which is clearli both darboux and riemann integr with integr zero therefor we will assum that r gt 0 if m gt 1 then we choos δ such that if m 1 then we choos δ to be less than one choos a tag partit x 0 ... x n and t 0 ... t n − 1 with mesh smaller than δ we must show that the riemann sum is within ε of s to see thi choos an interv x i x i 1 if thi interv is contain within some y j y j 1 then where m j and m j are respect the infimum and the supremum of f on y j y j 1 if all interv had thi properti then thi would conclud the proof becaus each term in the riemann sum would be bound by a correspond term in the darboux sum and we chose the darboux sum to be near s thi is the case when m 1 so the proof is finish in that case therefor we may assum that m gt 1 in thi case it is possibl that one of the x i x i 1 is not contain in ani y j y j 1 instead it may stretch across two of the interv determin by y 0 ... y m it can not meet three interv becaus δ is assum to be smaller than the length of ani one interv in symbol it may happen that we may assum that all the inequ are strict becaus otherwis we are in the previou case by our assumpt on the length of δ thi can happen at most m − 1 time to handl thi case we will estim the differ between the riemann sum and the darboux sum by subdivid the partit x 0 ... x n at y j 1 the term f t i x i 1 − x i in the riemann sum split into two term suppos without loss of gener that t i ∈ y j y j 1 then so thi term is bound by the correspond term in the darboux sum for y j to bound the other term notic that it follow that for some inde ani t i ∈ y j 1 x i 1 sinc thi happen at most m − 1 time the distanc between the riemann sum and a darboux sum is at most ε /2 therefor the distanc between the riemann sum and s is at most ε let f 0 1 → r be the function which take the valu 1 at everi point ani riemann sum of f on 0 1 will have the valu 1 therefor the riemann integr of f on 0 1 is 1. let i q 0 1 → r be the indic function of the ration number in 0 1 that is i q take the valu 1 on ration number and 0 on irrat number thi function doe not have a riemann integr to prove thi we will show how to construct tag partit whose riemann sum get arbitrarili close to both zero and one to start let x 0 ... x n and t 0 ... t n − 1 be a tag partit each t i is between x i and x i 1 choos ε gt 0 the t i have alreadi been chosen and we ca n't chang the valu of f at those point but if we cut the partit into tini piec around each t i we can minim the effect of the t i then by care choos the new tag we can make the valu of the riemann sum turn out to be within ε of either zero or one our first step is to cut up the partit there are n of the t i and we want their total effect to be less than ε if we confin each of them to an interv of length less than ε n then the contribut of each t i to the riemann sum will be at least 0 · ε n and at most 1 · ε n thi make the total sum at least zero and at most ε so let δ be a posit number less than ε n if it happen that two of the t i are within δ of each other choos δ smaller if it happen that some t i is within δ of some x j and t i is not equal to x j choos δ smaller sinc there are onli finit mani t i and x j we can alway choos δ suffici small now we add two cut to the partit for each t i one of the cut will be at t i − δ /2 and the other will be at t i δ /2 if one of these leav the interv 0 1 then we leav it out t i will be the tag correspond to the subinterv if t i is directli on top of one of the x j then we let t i be the tag for both interv we still have to choos tag for the other subinterv we will choos them in two differ way the first way is to alway choos a ration point so that the riemann sum is as larg as possibl thi will make the valu of the riemann sum at least 1 − ε the second way is to alway choos an irrat point so that the riemann sum is as small as possibl thi will make the valu of the riemann sum at most ε sinc we start from an arbitrari partit and end up as close as we want to either zero or one it is fals to say that we are eventu trap near some number s so thi function is not riemann integr howev it is lebesgu integr in the lebesgu sens it integr is zero sinc the function is zero almost everywher but thi is a fact that is beyond the reach of the riemann integr there are even wors exampl i q is equival that is equal almost everywher to a riemann integr function but there are non-riemann integr bound function which are not equival to ani riemann integr function for exampl let c be the smith–volterra–cantor set and let i c be it indic function becaus c is not jordan measur i c is not riemann integr moreov no function g equival to i c is riemann integr g like i c must be zero on a dens set so as in the previou exampl ani riemann sum of g ha a refin which is within ε of 0 for ani posit number ε but if the riemann integr of g exist then it must equal the lebesgu integr of i c which is 1/2 therefor g is not riemann integr it is popular to defin the riemann integr as the darboux integr thi is becaus the darboux integr is technic simpler and becaus a function is riemann-integr if and onli if it is darboux-integr some calculu book do not use gener tag partit but limit themselv to specif type of tag partit if the type of partit is limit too much some non-integr function may appear to be integr one popular restrict is the use of `` left-hand '' and `` right-hand '' riemann sum in a left-hand riemann sum t i x i for all i and in a right-hand riemann sum t i x i 1 for all i alon thi restrict doe not impos a problem we can refin ani partit in a way that make it a left-hand or right-hand sum by subdivid it at each t i in more formal languag the set of all left-hand riemann sum and the set of all right-hand riemann sum is cofin in the set of all tag partit anoth popular restrict is the use of regular subdivis of an interv for exampl the n th regular subdivis of 0 1 consist of the interv again alon thi restrict doe not impos a problem but the reason requir to see thi fact is more difficult than in the case of left-hand and right-hand riemann sum howev combin these restrict so that one use onli left-hand or right-hand riemann sum on regularli divid interv is danger if a function is known in advanc to be riemann integr then thi techniqu will give the correct valu of the integr but under these condit the indic function i q will appear to be integr on 0 1 with integr equal to one everi endpoint of everi subinterv will be a ration number so the function will alway be evalu at ration number and henc it will appear to alway equal one the problem with thi definit becom appar when we tri to split the integr into two piec the follow equat ought to hold if we use regular subdivis and left-hand or right-hand riemann sum then the two term on the left are equal to zero sinc everi endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrat but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1. as defin abov the riemann integr avoid thi problem by refus to integr i q the lebesgu integr is defin in such a way that all these integr are 0. the riemann integr is a linear transform that is if f and g are riemann-integr on a b and α and β are constant then becaus the riemann integr of a function is a number thi make the riemann integr a linear function on the vector space of riemann-integr function a bound function on a compact interv a b is riemann integr if and onli if it is continu almost everywher the set of it point of discontinu ha measur zero in the sens of lebesgu measur thi is known as the lebesgu 's integr condit or lebesgu 's criterion for riemann integr or the riemann–lebesgu theorem the criterion ha noth to do with the lebesgu integr it is due to lebesgu and use hi measur zero but make use of neither lebesgu 's gener measur or integr the integr condit can be proven in variou way one of which is sketch below one direct can be proven use the oscil definit of continu for everi posit ε let x ε be the set of point in a b with oscil of at least ε sinc everi point where f is discontinu ha a posit oscil and vice versa the set of point in a b where f is discontinu is equal to the union over for all natur number n if thi set doe not have a zero lebesgu measur then by countabl addit of the measur there is at least one such n so that x 1/ n doe not have a zero measur thu there is some posit number c such that everi countabl collect of open interv cover x 1/ n ha a total length of at least c in particular thi is also true for everi such finit collect of interv note that thi remain true also for x 1/ n less a finit number of point as a finit number of point can alway be cover by a finit collect of interv with arbitrarili small total length for everi partit of a b consid the set of interv whose interior includ point from x 1/ n these interior consist of a finit open cover of x 1/ n possibl up to a finit number of point which may fall on interv edg thu these interv have a total length of at least c sinc in these point f ha oscil of at least 1/ n the infimum and supremum of f in each of these interv differ by at least 1/ n thu the upper and lower sum of f differ by at least c n sinc thi is true for everi partit f is not riemann integr we now prove the convers direct use the set x ε defin abov note that for everi ε x ε is compact as it is bound by a and b and close now suppos that f is continu almost everywher then for everi ε x ε ha zero lebesgu measur therefor there is a countabl collect of open interv in a b which is an open cover of x ε such that the sum over all their length is arbitrarili small sinc x ε is compact there is a finit subcov – a finit collect of open interv in a b with arbitrarili small total length that togeth contain all point in x ε we denot these interv for 1 ≤ i ≤ k for some natur k the complement of the union of these interv is itself a union of a finit number of interv which we denot for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and possibl for i k k 1 as well we now show that for everi ε gt 0 there are upper and lower sum whose differ is less than ε from which riemann integr follow to thi end we construct a partit of a b as follow denot ε 1 ε 2 b − a and ε 2 ε 2 m − m where m and m are the infimum and supremum of f on a b sinc we may choos interv with arbitrarili small total length we choos them to have total length smaller than ε 2 each of the interv ha an empti intersect with x ε 1 so each point in it ha a neighborhood with oscil smaller than ε 1 these neighborhood consist of an open cover of the interv and sinc the interv is compact there is a finit subcov of them thi subcov is a finit collect of open interv which are subinterv of j ε 1 i except for those that includ an edg point for which we onli take their intersect with j ε 1 i we take the edg point of the subinterv for all j ε 1 i − s includ the edg point of the interv themselv as our partit thu the partit divid a b to two kind of interv in total the differ between the upper and lower sum of the partit is smaller than ε as requir in particular ani set that is at most countabl ha lebesgu measur zero and thu a bound function on a compact interv with onli finit or countabl mani discontinu is riemann integr an indic function of a bound set is riemann-integr if and onli if the set is jordan measur the riemann integr can be interpret measure-theoret as the integr with respect to the jordan measur if a real-valu function is monoton on the interv a b it is riemann-integr sinc it set of discontinu is at most countabl and therefor of lebesgu measur zero if a real-valu function on a b is riemann-integr it is lebesgue-integr that is riemann-integr is a stronger mean more difficult to satisfi condit than lebesgue-integr if f n is a uniformli converg sequenc on a b with limit f then riemann integr of all f n impli riemann integr of f and howev the lebesgu monoton converg theorem on a monoton pointwis limit doe not hold in riemann integr take limit under the integr sign is far more difficult to logic justifi than in lebesgu integr it is easi to extend the riemann integr to function with valu in the euclidean vector space r n for ani n the integr is defin component-wis in other word if f f 1 ... f n then in particular sinc the complex number are a real vector space thi allow the integr of complex valu function the riemann integr is onli defin on bound interv and it doe not extend well to unbound interv the simplest possibl extens is to defin such an integr as a limit in other word as an improp integr thi definit carri with it some subtleti such as the fact that it is not alway equival to comput the cauchi princip valu for exampl consid the function f x which is 0 at x 0 1 for x gt 0 and −1 for x lt 0 by symmetri alway regardless of a but there are mani way for the interv of integr to expand to fill the real line and other way can produc differ result in other word the multivari limit doe not alway exist we can comput in gener thi improp riemann integr is undefin even standard a way for the interv to approach the real line doe not work becaus it lead to disturbingli counterintuit result if we agre for instanc that the improp integr should alway be then the integr of the translat f x − 1 is −2 so thi definit is not invari under shift a highli undesir properti in fact not onli doe thi function not have an improp riemann integr it lebesgu integr is also undefin it equal ∞ − ∞ unfortun the improp riemann integr is not power enough the most sever problem is that there are no wide applic theorem for commut improp riemann integr with limit of function in applic such as fourier seri it is import to be abl to approxim the integr of a function use integr of approxim to the function for proper riemann integr a standard theorem state that if f n is a sequenc of function that converg uniformli to f on a compact set a b then on non-compact interv such as the real line thi is fals for exampl take f n x to be n −1 on 0 n and zero elsewher for all n we have the sequenc converg uniformli to the zero function and clearli the integr of the zero function is zero consequ thi demonstr that for integr on unbound interv uniform converg of a function is not strong enough to allow pass a limit through an integr sign thi make the riemann integr unwork in applic even though the riemann integr assign both side the correct valu becaus there is no other gener criterion for exchang a limit and a riemann integr and without such a criterion it is difficult to approxim integr by approxim their integrand a better rout is to abandon the riemann integr for the lebesgu integr the definit of the lebesgu integr is not obvious a gener of the riemann integr but it is not hard to prove that everi riemann-integr function is lebesgue-integr and that the valu of the two integr agre whenev they are both defin moreov a function f defin on a bound interv is riemann-integr if and onli if it is bound and the set of point where f is discontinu ha lebesgu measur zero an integr which is in fact a direct gener of the riemann integr is the henstock–kurzweil integr anoth way of gener the riemann integr is to replac the factor x k 1 − x k in the definit of a riemann sum by someth els roughli speak thi give the interv of integr a differ notion of length thi is the approach taken by the riemann–stieltj integr in multivari calculu the riemann integr for function from r n → r are multipl integr
