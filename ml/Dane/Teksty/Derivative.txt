the deriv of a function of a real variabl measur the sensit to chang of the function output valu with respect to a chang in it argument input valu deriv are a fundament tool of calculu for exampl the deriv of the posit of a move object with respect to time is the object 's veloc thi measur how quickli the posit of the object chang when time advanc the deriv of a function of a singl variabl at a chosen input valu when it exist is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point the tangent line is the best linear approxim of the function near that input valu for thi reason the deriv is often describ as the `` instantan rate of chang '' the ratio of the instantan chang in the depend variabl to that of the independ variabl deriv may be gener to function of sever real variabl in thi gener the deriv is reinterpret as a linear transform whose graph is after an appropri translat the best linear approxim to the graph of the origin function the jacobian matrix is the matrix that repres thi linear transform with respect to the basi given by the choic of independ and depend variabl it can be calcul in term of the partial deriv with respect to the independ variabl for a real-valu function of sever variabl the jacobian matrix reduc to the gradient vector the process of find a deriv is call differenti the revers process is call antidifferenti the fundament theorem of calculu state that antidifferenti is the same as integr differenti and integr constitut the two fundament oper in single-vari calculu note 1 differenti is the action of comput a deriv the deriv of a function y f x of a variabl x is a measur of the rate at which the valu y of the function chang with respect to the chang of the variabl x it is call the deriv of f with respect to x if x and y are real number and if the graph of f is plot against x the deriv is the slope of thi graph at each point the simplest case apart from the trivial case of a constant function is when y is a linear function of x mean that the graph of y is a line in thi case y f x m x b for real number m and b and the slope m is given by where the symbol δ delta is an abbrevi for `` chang in '' thi formula is true becaus thu sinc it follow that thi give an exact valu for the slope of a line if the function f is not linear i.e it graph is not a straight line howev then the chang in y divid by the chang in x vari differenti is a method to find an exact valu for thi rate of chang at ani given valu of x the idea illustr by figur 1 to 3 is to comput the rate of chang as the limit valu of the ratio of the differ δ y δ x as δ x becom infinit small two distinct notat are commonli use for the deriv one deriv from leibniz and the other from joseph loui lagrang in leibniz 's notat an infinitesim chang in x is denot by dx and the deriv of y with respect to x is written suggest the ratio of two infinitesim quantiti the abov express is read as `` the deriv of y with respect to x `` `` d y by d x '' or `` d y over d x '' the oral form `` d y d x '' is often use convers although it may lead to confus in lagrang 's notat the deriv with respect to x of a function f x is denot f x read as `` f prime of x '' or f x x read as `` f prime x of x '' in case of ambigu of the variabl impli by the deriv lagrang 's notat is sometim incorrectli attribut to newton the most common approach to turn thi intuit idea into a precis definit is to defin the deriv as a limit of differ quotient of real number thi is the approach describ below let f be a real valu function defin in an open neighborhood of a real number a in classic geometri the tangent line to the graph of the function f at a wa the uniqu line through the point a f a that did not meet the graph of f transvers mean that the line did not pass straight through the graph the deriv of y with respect to x at a is geometr the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at a f a the slope of the tangent line is veri close to the slope of the line through a f a and a nearbi point on the graph for exampl a h f a h these line are call secant line a valu of h close to zero give a good approxim to the slope of the tangent line and smaller valu in absolut valu of h will in gener give better approxim the slope m of the secant line is the differ between the y valu of these point divid by the differ between the x valu that is thi express is newton 's differ quotient pass from an approxim to an exact answer is done use a limit geometr the limit of the secant line is the tangent line therefor the limit of the differ quotient as h approach zero if it exist should repres the slope of the tangent line to a f a thi limit is defin to be the deriv of the function f at a when the limit exist f is said to be differenti at a here f ′ a is one of sever common notat for the deriv see below equival the deriv satisfi the properti that which ha the intuit interpret see figur 1 that the tangent line to f at a give the best linear approxim to f near a i.e. for small h thi interpret is the easiest to gener to other set see below substitut 0 for h in the differ quotient caus divis by zero so the slope of the tangent line can not be found directli use thi method instead defin q h to be the differ quotient as a function of h q h is the slope of the secant line between a f a and a h f a h if f is a continu function mean that it graph is an unbroken curv with no gap then q is a continu function away from h 0 if the limit lim h →0 q h exist mean that there is a way of choos a valu for q 0 that make q a continu function then the function f is differenti at a and it deriv at a equal q 0 in practic the exist of a continu extens of the differ quotient q h to h 0 is shown by modifi the numer to cancel h in the denomin such manipul can make the limit valu of q for small h clear even though q is still not defin at h 0 thi process can be long and tediou for complic function and mani shortcut are commonli use to simplifi the process rel to a hyperr extens r ⊂ r of the real number the deriv of a real function y f x at a real point x can be defin as the shadow of the quotient ∆ y ∆ x for infinitesim ∆ x where ∆ y f x ∆ x f x here the natur extens of f to the hyperr is still denot f here the deriv is said to exist if the shadow is independ of the infinitesim chosen the squar function f x x 2 is differenti at x 3 and it deriv there is 6 thi result is establish by calcul the limit as h approach zero of the differ quotient of f 3 the last express show that the differ quotient equal 6 h when h ≠ 0 and is undefin when h 0 becaus of the definit of the differ quotient howev the definit of the limit say the differ quotient doe not need to be defin when h 0 the limit is the result of let h go to zero mean it is the valu that 6 h tend to as h becom veri small henc the slope of the graph of the squar function at the point 3 9 is 6 and so it deriv at x 3 is f ′ 3 6 more gener a similar comput show that the deriv of the squar function at x a is f ′ a 2 a if y f x is differenti at a then f must also be continu at a as an exampl choos a point a and let f be the step function that return a valu say 1 for all x less than a and return a differ valu say 10 for all x greater than or equal to a f can not have a deriv at a if h is neg then a h is on the low part of the step so the secant line from a to a h is veri steep and as h tend to zero the slope tend to infin if h is posit then a h is on the high part of the step so the secant line from a to a h ha slope zero consequ the secant line do not approach ani singl slope so the limit of the differ quotient doe not exist note 2 howev even if a function is continu at a point it may not be differenti there for exampl the absolut valu function y x is continu at x 0 but it is not differenti there if h is posit then the slope of the secant line from 0 to h is one wherea if h is neg then the slope of the secant line from 0 to h is neg one thi can be seen graphic as a `` kink '' or a `` cusp '' in the graph at x 0 even a function with a smooth graph is not differenti at a point where it tangent is vertic for instanc the function y x 1/3 is not differenti at x 0 in summari for a function f to have a deriv it is necessari for the function f to be continu but continu alon is not suffici most function that occur in practic have deriv at all point or at almost everi point earli in the histori of calculu mani mathematician assum that a continu function wa differenti at most point under mild condit for exampl if the function is a monoton function or a lipschitz function thi is true howev in 1872 weierstrass found the first exampl of a function that is continu everywher but differenti nowher thi exampl is now known as the weierstrass function in 1931 stefan banach prove that the set of function that have a deriv at some point is a meager set in the space of all continu function inform thi mean that hardli ani continu function have a deriv at even one point let f be a function that ha a deriv at everi point a in the domain of f becaus everi point a ha a deriv there is a function that send the point a to the deriv of f at a thi function is written f ′ x and is call the deriv function or the deriv of f the deriv of f collect all the deriv of f at all the point in the domain of f sometim f ha a deriv at most but not all point of it domain the function whose valu at a equal f ′ a whenev f ′ a is defin and elsewher is undefin is also call the deriv of f it is still a function but it domain is strictli smaller than the domain of f use thi idea differenti becom a function of function the deriv is an oper whose domain is the set of all function that have deriv at everi point of their domain and whose rang is a set of function if we denot thi oper by d then d f is the function f ′ x sinc d f is a function it can be evalu at a point a by the definit of the deriv function d f a f ′ a for comparison consid the doubl function f x 2 x f is a real-valu function of a real number mean that it take number as input and ha number as output the oper d howev is not defin on individu number it is onli defin on function becaus the output of d is a function the output of d can be evalu at a point for instanc when d is appli to the squar function x ↦ x 2 d output the doubl function x ↦ 2 x which we name f x thi output function can then be evalu to get f 1 2 f 2 4 and so on let f be a differenti function and let f ′ x be it deriv the deriv of f ′ x if it ha one is written f ′′ x and is call the second deriv of f similarli the deriv of a second deriv if it exist is written f ′′′ x and is call the third deriv of f continu thi process one can defin if it exist the n th deriv as the deriv of the n -1 th deriv these repeat deriv are call higher-ord deriv the n th deriv is also call the deriv of order n if x t repres the posit of an object at time t then the higher-ord deriv of x have physic interpret the second deriv of x is the deriv of x ′ t the veloc and by definit thi is the object 's acceler the third deriv of x is defin to be the jerk and the fourth deriv is defin to be the jounc a function f need not have a deriv for exampl if it is not continu similarli even if f doe have a deriv it may not have a second deriv for exampl let calcul show that f is a differenti function whose deriv is f ′ x is twice the absolut valu function and it doe not have a deriv at zero similar exampl show that a function can have k deriv for ani non-neg integ k but no k 1 th-order deriv a function that ha k success deriv is call k time differenti if in addit the k th deriv is continu then the function is said to be of differenti class c k thi is a stronger condit than have k deriv for an exampl see differenti class a function that ha infinit mani deriv is call infinit differenti or smooth on the real line everi polynomi function is infinit differenti by standard differenti rule if a polynomi of degre n is differenti n time then it becom a constant function all of it subsequ deriv are ident zero in particular they exist so polynomi are smooth function the deriv of a function f at a point x provid polynomi approxim to that function near x for exampl if f is twice differenti then in the sens that if f is infinit differenti then thi is the begin of the taylor seri for f evalu at x h around x a point where the second deriv of a function chang sign is call an inflect point at an inflect point the second deriv may be zero as in the case of the inflect point x 0 of the function y x 3 or it may fail to exist as in the case of the inflect point x 0 of the function y x 1/3 at an inflect point a function switch from be a convex function to be a concav function or vice versa the symbol dx dy and dx/di were introduc by gottfri wilhelm leibniz in 1675 it is still commonli use when the equat y f x is view as a function relationship between depend and independ variabl then the first deriv is denot by and wa onc thought of as an infinitesim quotient higher deriv are express use the notat for the n th deriv of y f x with respect to x these are abbrevi for multipl applic of the deriv oper for exampl with leibniz 's notat we can write the deriv of y at the point x a in two differ way leibniz 's notat allow one to specifi the variabl for differenti in the denomin thi is especi relev for partial differenti it also make the chain rule easi to rememb note 3 sometim refer to as prime notat one of the most common modern notat for differenti is due to joseph-loui lagrang and use the prime mark so that the deriv of a function f x is denot f ′ x or simpli f ′ similarli the second and third deriv are denot to denot the number of deriv beyond thi point some author use roman numer in superscript wherea other place the number in parenthes the latter notat gener to yield the notat f n for the n th deriv of f – thi notat is most use when we wish to talk about the deriv as be a function itself as in thi case the leibniz notat can becom cumbersom newton 's notat for differenti also call the dot notat place a dot over the function name to repres a time deriv if y f t then denot respect the first and second deriv of y with respect to t thi notat is use exclus for deriv with respect to time or arc length it is veri common in physic differenti equat and differenti geometri while the notat becom unmanag for high-ord deriv in practic onli few deriv are need euler 's notat use a differenti oper d which is appli to a function f to give the first deriv df the second deriv is denot d 2 f and the n th deriv is denot d n f if y f x is a depend variabl then often the subscript x is attach to the d to clarifi the independ variabl x euler 's notat is then written although thi subscript is often omit when the variabl x is understood for instanc when thi is the onli variabl present in the express euler 's notat is use for state and solv linear differenti equat the deriv of a function can in principl be comput from the definit by consid the differ quotient and comput it limit in practic onc the deriv of a few simpl function are known the deriv of other function are more easili comput use rule for obtain deriv of more complic function from simpler one most deriv comput eventu requir take the deriv of some common function the follow incomplet list give some of the most frequent use function of a singl real variabl and their deriv where r is ani real number then wherev thi function is defin for exampl if f x x 1 4 \displaystyl f x =x^ then and the deriv function is defin onli for posit x not for x 0 when r 0 thi rule impli that f ′ x is zero for x ≠ 0 which is almost the constant rule state below in mani case complic limit calcul by direct applic of newton 's differ quotient can be avoid use differenti rule some of the most basic rule are the follow the deriv of is here the second term wa comput use the chain rule and third use the product rule the known deriv of the elementari function x 2 x 4 sin x ln x and exp x e x as well as the constant 7 were also use a vector-valu function y t of a real variabl send real number to vector in some vector space r n a vector-valu function can be split up into it coordin function y 1 t y 2 t … y n t mean that y t y 1 t ... y n t thi includ for exampl parametr curv in r 2 or r 3 the coordin function are real valu function so the abov definit of deriv appli to them the deriv of y t is defin to be the vector call the tangent vector whose coordin are the deriv of the coordin function that is equival if the limit exist the subtract in the numer is subtract of vector not scalar if the deriv of y exist for everi valu of t then y ′ is anoth vector valu function if e 1 … e n is the standard basi for r n then y t can also be written as y 1 t e 1 … y n t e n if we assum that the deriv of a vector-valu function retain the linear properti then the deriv of y t must be becaus each of the basi vector is a constant thi gener is use for exampl if y t is the posit vector of a particl at time t then the deriv y ′ t is the veloc vector of the particl at time t suppos that f is a function that depend on more than one variable—for instanc f can be reinterpret as a famili of function of one variabl index by the other variabl in other word everi valu of x choos a function denot f x which is a function of one real number note 4 that is onc a valu of x is chosen say a then f x y determin a function f a that send y to a 2 ay y 2 in thi express a is a constant not a variabl so f a is a function of onli one real variabl consequ the definit of the deriv for a function of one variabl appli the abov procedur can be perform for ani choic of a assembl the deriv togeth into a function give a function that describ the variat of f in the y direct thi is the partial deriv of f with respect to y here ∂ is a round d call the partial deriv symbol to distinguish it from the letter d ∂ is sometim pronounc `` der '' `` del '' or `` partial '' instead of `` dee '' in gener the partial deriv of a function f x 1 … x n in the direct x i at the point a 1 … a n is defin to be in the abov differ quotient all the variabl except x i are held fix that choic of fix valu determin a function of one variabl and by definit in other word the differ choic of a index a famili of one-vari function just as in the exampl abov thi express also show that the comput of partial deriv reduc to the comput of one-vari deriv an import exampl of a function of sever variabl is the case of a scalar-valu function f x 1 ... x n on a domain in euclidean space r n e.g. on r 2 or r 3 in thi case f ha a partial deriv ∂ f /∂ x j with respect to each variabl x j at the point a these partial deriv defin the vector thi vector is call the gradient of f at a if f is differenti at everi point in some domain then the gradient is a vector-valu function ∇ f that take the point a to the vector ∇ f a consequ the gradient determin a vector field if f is a real-valu function on r n then the partial deriv of f measur it variat in the direct of the coordin axe for exampl if f is a function of x and y then it partial deriv measur the variat in f in the x direct and the y direct they do not howev directli measur the variat of f in ani other direct such as along the diagon line y x these are measur use direct deriv choos a vector the direct deriv of f in the direct of v at the point x is the limit in some case it may be easier to comput or estim the direct deriv after chang the length of the vector often thi is done to turn the problem into the comput of a direct deriv in the direct of a unit vector to see how thi work suppos that v λ u substitut h k /λ into the differ quotient the differ quotient becom thi is λ time the differ quotient for the direct deriv of f with respect to u furthermor take the limit as h tend to zero is the same as take the limit as k tend to zero becaus h and k are multipl of each other therefor d v f λ d u f becaus of thi rescal properti direct deriv are frequent consid onli for unit vector if all the partial deriv of f exist and are continu at x then they determin the direct deriv of f in the direct v by the formula thi is a consequ of the definit of the total deriv it follow that the direct deriv is linear in v mean that d v w f d v f d w f the same definit also work when f is a function with valu in r m the abov definit is appli to each compon of the vector in thi case the direct deriv is a vector in r m when f is a function from an open subset of r n to r m then the direct deriv of f in a chosen direct is the best linear approxim to f at that point and in that direct but when n gt 1 no singl direct deriv can give a complet pictur of the behavior of f the total deriv give a complet pictur by consid all direct at onc that is for ani vector v start at a the linear approxim formula hold just like the single-vari deriv f ′ a is chosen so that the error in thi approxim is as small as possibl if n and m are both one then the deriv f ′ a is a number and the express f ′ a v is the product of two number but in higher dimens it is imposs for f ′ a to be a number if it were a number then f ′ a v would be a vector in r n while the other term would be vector in r m and therefor the formula would not make sens for the linear approxim formula to make sens f ′ a must be a function that send vector in r n to vector in r m and f ′ a v must denot thi function evalu at v to determin what kind of function it is notic that the linear approxim formula can be rewritten as notic that if we choos anoth vector w then thi approxim equat determin anoth approxim equat by substitut w for v it determin a third approxim equat by substitut both w for v and a v for a by subtract these two new equat we get if we assum that v is small and that the deriv vari continu in a then f ′ a v is approxim equal to f ′ a and therefor the right-hand side is approxim zero the left-hand side can be rewritten in a differ way use the linear approxim formula with v w substitut for v the linear approxim formula impli thi suggest that f ′ a is a linear transform from the vector space r n to the vector space r m in fact it is possibl to make thi a precis deriv by measur the error in the approxim assum that the error in these linear approxim formula is bound by a constant time || v || where the constant is independ of v but depend continu on a then after ad an appropri error term all of the abov approxim equal can be rephras as inequ in particular f ′ a is a linear transform up to a small error term in the limit as v and w tend to zero it must therefor be a linear transform sinc we defin the total deriv by take a limit as v goe to zero f ′ a must be a linear transform in one variabl the fact that the deriv is the best linear approxim is express by the fact that it is the limit of differ quotient howev the usual differ quotient doe not make sens in higher dimens becaus it is not usual possibl to divid vector in particular the numer and denomin of the differ quotient are not even in the same vector space the numer lie in the codomain r m while the denomin lie in the domain r n furthermor the deriv is a linear transform a differ type of object from both the numer and denomin to make precis the idea that f ′ a is the best linear approxim it is necessari to adapt a differ formula for the one-vari deriv in which these problem disappear if f r → r then the usual definit of the deriv may be manipul to show that the deriv of f at a is the uniqu number f ′ a such that thi is equival to becaus the limit of a function tend to zero if and onli if the limit of the absolut valu of the function tend to zero thi last formula can be adapt to the many-vari situat by replac the absolut valu with norm the definit of the total deriv of f at a therefor is that it is the uniqu linear transform f ′ a r n → r m such that here h is a vector in r n so the norm in the denomin is the standard length on r n howev f ′ a h is a vector in r m and the norm in the numer is the standard length on r m if v is a vector start at a then f ′ a v is call the pushforward of v by f and is sometim written f ∗ v if the total deriv exist at a then all the partial deriv and direct deriv of f exist at a and for all v f ′ a v is the direct deriv of f in the direct v if we write f use coordin function so that f f 1 f 2 ... f m then the total deriv can be express use the partial deriv as a matrix thi matrix is call the jacobian matrix of f at a the exist of the total deriv f ′ a is strictli stronger than the exist of all the partial deriv but if the partial deriv exist and are continu then the total deriv exist is given by the jacobian and depend continu on a the definit of the total deriv subsum the definit of the deriv in one variabl that is if f is a real-valu function of a real variabl then the total deriv exist if and onli if the usual deriv exist the jacobian matrix reduc to a 1×1 matrix whose onli entri is the deriv f ′ x thi 1×1 matrix satisfi the properti that f a h − f a − f ′ a h is approxim zero in other word that up to chang variabl thi is the statement that the function x ↦ f a f ′ a x − a is the best linear approxim to f at a the total deriv of a function doe not give anoth function in the same way as the one-vari case thi is becaus the total deriv of a multivari function ha to record much more inform than the deriv of a single-vari function instead the total deriv give a function from the tangent bundl of the sourc to the tangent bundl of the target the natur analog of second third and higher-ord total deriv is not a linear transform is not a function on the tangent bundl and is not built by repeatedli take the total deriv the analog of a higher-ord deriv call a jet can not be a linear transform becaus higher-ord deriv reflect subtl geometr inform such as concav which can not be describ in term of linear data such as vector it can not be a function on the tangent bundl becaus the tangent bundl onli ha room for the base space and the direct deriv becaus jet captur higher-ord inform they take as argument addit coordin repres higher-ord chang in direct the space determin by these addit coordin is call the jet bundl the relat between the total deriv and the partial deriv of a function is parallel in the relat between the k th order jet of a function and it partial deriv of order less than or equal to k by repeatedli take the total deriv one obtain higher version of the fréchet deriv special to r p the k th order total deriv may be interpret as a map which take a point x in r n and assign to it an element of the space of k -linear map from r n to r m – the `` best '' in a certain precis sens k -linear approxim to f at that point by precompos it with the diagon map δ x → x x a gener taylor seri may be begun as where f a is identifi with a constant function x i − a i are the compon of the vector x − a and df i and d 2 f jk are the compon of df and d 2 f as linear transform the concept of a deriv can be extend to mani other set the common thread is that the deriv of a function at a point serv as a linear approxim of the function at that point
