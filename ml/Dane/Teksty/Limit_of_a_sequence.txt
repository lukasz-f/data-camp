the modern definit of a limit for ani ε there exist an index n so that ... wa given by bernhard bolzano der binomisch lehrsatz pragu 1816 littl notic at the time and by karl weierstrass in the 1870 in the real number a number l is the limit of the sequenc x n \displaystyl x_ if the number in the sequenc becom closer and closer to l and not to ani other number we call x the limit of the sequenc x n \displaystyl x_ if the follow condit hold in other word for everi measur of close ϵ the sequenc 's term are eventu that close to the limit the sequenc x n \displaystyl x_ is said to converg to or tend to the limit x written x n → x \displaystyl x_ \to x or lim n → ∞ x n x \displaystyl \lim x_ =x symbol thi is if a sequenc converg to some limit then it is converg otherwis it is diverg exampl of a sequenc which converg to the limit a regardless which ε gt 0 we have there is an index n 0 \displaystyl n_ so that the sequenc lie afterward complet in the epsilon tube a − ε a ε there is also for a

there are onli finitli mani sequenc member outsid the epsilon tube limit of sequenc behav well with respect to the usual arithmet oper if a n → a \displaystyl a_ \to a and b n → b \displaystyl b_ \to

for ani continu function f if x n → x \displaystyl x_ \to x then f x n → f x \displaystyl f x_ \to f x in fact ani real-valu function f is continu if and onli if it preserv the limit of sequenc though thi is not necessarili true when use more gener notion of continu some other import properti of limit of real sequenc includ the follow provid in each equat below that the limit on the right exist these properti are extens use to prove limit without the need to directli use the cumbersom formal definit onc proven that 1 n → 0 \displaystyl \frac \to 0 it becom easi to show that a b c n → a b \displaystyl \frac b+ \frac \to \frac b ≠ 0 use the properti abov a sequenc x n \displaystyl x_ is said to tend to infin written x n → ∞ \displaystyl x_ \to \infti or lim n → ∞ x n ∞ \displaystyl \lim

distanc so for ϵ less than half thi distanc sequenc term can not be within a distanc ϵ of both point a point x of the topolog space x τ is the limit of the sequenc x n if for everi neighbourhood u of

of n \displaystyl \mathbb if x is a hausdorff space then limit of sequenc are uniqu where they exist note that thi need not be the case in gener in particular if two point x and y are topolog indistinguish ani sequenc that converg to x must converg to y and vice versa a cauchi sequenc is a sequenc whose term ultim becom arbitrarili close togeth after suffici mani initi term have been discard the notion of a cauchi sequenc is import in the studi of sequenc in metric space and in particular in real analysi one particularli import result in real analysi is the cauchi criterion for converg of sequenc a sequenc of real number is converg if and onli if it is a cauchi sequenc thi remain true in other complet metric space the definit of the limit use the hyperr number formal the
