in mathemat an integr assign number to function in a way that can describ displac area volum and other concept that aris by combin infinitesim data integr is one of the two main oper of calculu with it invers differenti be the other given a function f of a real variabl x and an interv a b of the real line the definit integr is defin inform as the sign area of the region in the xy -plane that is bound by the graph of f the x -axi and the vertic line x a and x b the area abov the x -axi add to the total and that below the x -axi subtract from the total roughli speak the oper of integr is the revers of differenti for thi reason the term integr may also refer to the relat notion of the antideriv a function f whose deriv is the given function f in thi case it is call an indefinit integr and is written the integr discuss in thi articl are those term definit integr it is the fundament theorem of calculu that connect differenti with the definit integr if f is a continu real-valu function defin on a close interv a b then onc an antideriv f of f is known the definit integr of f over that interv is given by the principl of integr were formul independ by isaac newton and gottfri leibniz in the late 17th centuri who thought of the integr as an infinit sum of rectangl of infinitesim width a rigor mathemat definit of the integr wa given by bernhard riemann it is base on a limit procedur that approxim the area of a curvilinear region by break the region into thin vertic slab begin in the nineteenth centuri more sophist notion of integr began to appear where the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integr is perform ha been generalis a line integr is defin for function of two or three variabl and the interv of integr a b is replac by a certain curv connect two point on the plane or in the space in a surfac integr the curv is replac by a piec of a surfac in the three-dimension space the first document systemat techniqu capabl of determin integr is the method of exhaust of the ancient greek astronom eudoxu ca 370 bc which sought to find area and volum by break them up into an infinit number of divis for which the area or volum wa known thi method wa further develop and employ by archimed in the 3rd centuri bc and use to calcul area for parabola and an approxim to the area of a circl a similar method wa independ develop in china around the 3rd centuri ad by liu hui who use it to find the area of the circl thi method wa later use in the 5th centuri by chines father-and-son mathematician zu chongzhi and zu geng to find the volum of a sphere shea 2007 katz 2004 pp 125–126 the next signific advanc in integr calculu did not begin to appear until the 17th centuri at thi time the work of cavalieri with hi method of indivis and work by fermat began to lay the foundat of modern calculu with cavalieri comput the integr of x n up to degre n 9 in cavalieri 's quadratur formula further step were made in the earli 17th centuri by barrow and torricelli who provid the first hint of a connect between integr and differenti barrow provid the first proof of the fundament theorem of calculu walli gener cavalieri 's method comput integr of x to a gener power includ neg power and fraction power the major advanc in integr came in the 17th centuri with the independ discoveri of the fundament theorem of calculu by newton and leibniz the theorem demonstr a connect between integr and differenti thi connect combin with the compar eas of differenti can be exploit to calcul integr in particular the fundament theorem of calculu allow one to solv a much broader class of problem equal in import is the comprehens mathemat framework that both newton and leibniz develop given the name infinitesim calculu it allow for precis analysi of function within continu domain thi framework eventu becam modern calculu whose notat for integr is drawn directli from the work of leibniz while newton and leibniz provid a systemat approach to integr their work lack a degre of rigour bishop berkeley memor attack the vanish increment use by newton call them `` ghost of depart quantiti `` calculu acquir a firmer foot with the develop of limit integr wa first rigor formal use limit by riemann although all bound piecewis continu function are riemann-integr on a bound interv subsequ more gener function were considered—particularli in the context of fourier analysi —to which riemann 's definit doe not appli and lebesgu formul a differ definit of integr found in measur theori a subfield of real analysi other definit of integr extend riemann 's and lebesgu 's approach were propos these approach base on the real number system are the one most common today but altern approach exist such as a definit of integr as the standard part of an infinit riemann sum base on the hyperr number system isaac newton use a small vertic bar abov a variabl to indic integr or place the variabl insid a box the vertic bar wa easili confus with x or x ′ which are use to indic differenti and the box notat wa difficult for printer to reproduc so these notat were not wide adopt the modern notat for the indefinit integr wa introduc by gottfri leibniz in 1675 burton 1988 p. 359 leibniz 1899 p. 154 he adapt the integr symbol ∫ from the letter ſ long s stand for summa written as ſumma latin for `` sum '' or `` total '' the modern notat for the definit integr with limit abov and below the integr sign wa first use by joseph fourier in mémoir of the french academi around 1819–20 reprint in hi book of 1822 cajori 1929 pp 249–250 fourier 1822 §231 the integr with respect to x of a real-valu function f x of a real variabl x on the interv a b is written as the integr sign ∫ repres integr the symbol dx call the differenti of the variabl x indic that the variabl of integr is x the function f x to be integr is call the integrand the symbol dx is separ from the integrand by a space as shown if a function ha an integr it is said to be integr the point a and b are call the limit of the integr an integr where the limit are specifi is call a definit integr the integr is said to be over the interv a b when the limit are omit as in the integr is call an indefinit integr which repres a class of function the antideriv whose deriv is the integrand the fundament theorem of calculu relat the evalu of definit integr to indefinit integr occasion limit of integr are omit for definit integr when the same limit occur repeatedli in a particular context usual the author will make thi convent clear at the begin of the relev text there are sever extens of the notat for integr to encompass integr on unbound domain and/or in multipl dimens see later section of thi articl histor the symbol dx wa taken to repres an infinitesim `` small piec '' of the independ variabl x to be multipli by the integrand and sum up in an infinit sens while thi notion is still heurist use later mathematician have deem infinitesim quantiti to be unten from the standpoint of the real number system in introductori calculu the express dx is therefor not assign an independ mean instead it is view as part of the symbol for integr and serv as it delimit in more sophist context dx can have it own signific the mean of which depend on the particular area of mathemat in question the origin leibnitz notat wa co-opt in variou effort to make precis and extend the definit of the integr to increasingli gener scenario give rise to sever distinct usag some common interpret of dx includ an integr function in riemann-stieltj integr indic by dα x in gener a measur in lebesgu theori indic by dμ in gener or a differenti form in exterior calculu indic by d x i 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ d x i k \displaystyl dx^ i_ \wedg \cdot \wedg dx^ i_ in gener in the latter even the letter d ha an independ mean — as the exterior deriv oper on form moreov in advanc set it is not uncommon to leav out dx when onli the simpl riemann integr is be use or the exact type of integr is immateri for instanc one might write ∫ a b c 1 f c 2 g c 1 ∫ a b f c 2 ∫ a b g \textstyl \int c_ f+c_ g =c_ \int f+c_ \int g to express the linear of the integr a properti share by the riemann integr and all gener thereof in modern arab mathemat notat a reflect integr symbol is use instead of the symbol ∫ sinc the arab script and mathemat express go right to left some author particularli of european origin use an upright `` d '' to indic the variabl of integr i.e. d x instead of dx sinc properli speak `` d '' is not a variabl also the symbol dx is not alway place after f x as for instanc in in the first express the differenti is treat as an infinitesim `` multipl '' factor formal follow a `` commut properti '' when `` multipli '' by the express 3/ x 2 +1 in the second express show the differenti first highlight and clarifi the variabl that are be integr with respect to a practic particularli popular with physicist integr appear in mani practic situat if a swim pool is rectangular with a flat bottom then from it length width and depth we can easili determin the volum of water it can contain to fill it the area of it surfac to cover it and the length of it edg to rope it but if it is oval with a round bottom all of these quantiti call for integr practic approxim may suffic for such trivial exampl but precis engin of ani disciplin requir exact and rigor valu for these element to start off consid the curv y f x between x 0 and x 1 with f x √ x see figur we ask and call thi yet unknown area the definit integr of f the notat for thi integr will be as a first approxim look at the unit squar given by the side x 0 to x 1 and y f 0 0 and y f 1 1 it area is exactli 1 as it is the true valu of the integr must be somewhat less than 1 decreas the width of the approxim rectangl and increas the number of rectangl shall give a better result so cross the interv in five step use the approxim point 0 1/5 2/5 and so on to 1 fit a box for each step use the right end height of each curv piec thu √ 1/5 √ 2/5 and so on to √ 1 1 sum the area of these rectangl we get a better approxim for the sought integr name we are take a sum of finit mani function valu of f multipli with the differ of two subsequ approxim point we can easili see that the approxim is still too larg use more step produc a closer approxim but will never be exact replac the five subinterv by twelv in the same way but with the left end height of each piec we will get an approxim valu for the area of 0.6203 which is too small the key idea is the transit from ad finit mani differ of approxim point multipli by their respect function valu to use infinit mani fine or infinitesim step the notat conceiv the integr as a weight sum denot by the elong s of function valu f x multipli by infinitesim step width the so-cal differenti denot by dx the multipl sign is usual omit histor after the failur of earli effort to rigor interpret infinitesim riemann formal defin integr as a limit of weight sum so that the dx suggest the limit of a differ name the interv width shortcom of riemann 's depend on interv and continu motiv newer definit especi the lebesgu integr which is found on an abil to extend the idea of `` measur '' in much more flexibl way thu the notat refer to a weight sum in which the function valu are partit with μ measur the weight to be assign to each valu here a denot the region of integr there are mani way of formal defin an integr not all of which are equival the differ exist mostli to deal with differ special case which may not be integr under other definit but also occasion for pedagog reason the most commonli use definit of integr are riemann integr and lebesgu integr the riemann integr is defin in term of riemann sum of function with respect to tag partit of an interv let a b be a close interv of the real line then a tag partit of a b is a finit sequenc thi partit the interv a b into n sub-interv x i −1 x i index by i each of which is `` tag '' with a distinguish point t i ∈ x i −1 x i a riemann sum of a function f with respect to such a tag partit is defin as thu each term of the sum is the area of a rectangl with height equal to the function valu at the distinguish point of the given sub-interv and width the same as the sub-interv width let δ i x i − x i −1 be the width of sub-interv i then the mesh of such a tag partit is the width of the largest sub-interv form by the partit max i =1 ... n δ i the riemann integr of a function f over the interv a b is equal to s if when the chosen tag give the maximum respect minimum valu of each interv the riemann sum becom an upper respect lower darboux sum suggest the close connect between the riemann integr and the darboux integr it is often of interest both in theori and applic to be abl to pass to the limit under the integr for instanc a sequenc of function can frequent be construct that approxim in a suitabl sens the solut to a problem then the integr of the solut function should be the limit of the integr of the approxim howev mani function that can be obtain as limit are not riemann-integr and so such limit theorem do not hold with the riemann integr therefor it is of great import to have a definit of the integr that allow a wider class of function to be integr rudin 1987 such an integr is the lebesgu integr that exploit the follow fact to enlarg the class of integr function if the valu of a function are rearrang over the domain the integr of a function should remain the same thu henri lebesgu introduc the integr bear hi name explain thi integr thu in a letter to paul montel i have to pay a certain sum which i have collect in my pocket i take the bill and coin out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order i find them until i have reach the total sum thi is the riemann integr but i can proceed differ after i have taken all the money out of my pocket i order the bill and coin accord to ident valu and then i pay the sever heap one after the other to the creditor thi is my integr as folland 1984 p. 56 put it `` to comput the riemann integr of f one partit the domain a b into subinterv '' while in the lebesgu integr `` one is in effect partit the rang of f `` the definit of the lebesgu integr thu begin with a measur μ in the simplest case the lebesgu measur μ a of an interv a a b is it width b − a so that the lebesgu integr agre with the proper riemann integr when both exist in more complic case the set be measur can be highli fragment with no continu and no resembl to interv use the `` partit the rang of f `` philosophi the integr of a non-neg function f r → r should be the sum over t of the area between a thin horizont strip between y t and y t dt thi area is just μ dt let f ∗ t μ the lebesgu integr of f is then defin by lieb amp loss 2001 where the integr on the right is an ordinari improp riemann integr f ∗ is a strictli decreas posit function and therefor ha a well-defin improp riemann integr for a suitabl class of function the measur function thi defin the lebesgu integr a gener measur function f is lebesgue-integr if the area between the graph of f and the x -axi is finit in that case the integr is as in the riemannian case the differ between the area abov the x -axi and the area below the x -axi where although the riemann and lebesgu integr are the most wide use definit of the integr a number of other exist includ the collect of riemann-integr function on a close interv a b form a vector space under the oper of pointwis addit and multipl by a scalar and the oper of integr is a linear function on thi vector space thu firstli the collect of integr function is close under take linear combin and secondli the integr of a linear combin is the linear combin of the integr similarli the set of real -valu lebesgue-integr function on a given measur space e with measur μ is close under take linear combin and henc form a vector space and the lebesgu integr is a linear function on thi vector space so that more gener consid the vector space of all measur function on a measur space e μ take valu in a local compact complet topolog vector space v over a local compact topolog field k f e → v then one may defin an abstract integr map assign to each function f an element of v or the symbol ∞ that is compat with linear combin in thi situat the linear hold for the subspac of function whose integr is an element of v i.e `` finit '' the most import special case aris when k is r c or a finit extens of the field q p of p-adic number and v is a finite-dimension vector space over k and when k c and v is a complex hilbert space linear togeth with some natur continu properti and normalis for a certain class of `` simpl '' function may be use to give an altern definit of the integr thi is the approach of daniel for the case of real-valu function on a set x gener by nicola bourbaki to function with valu in a local compact topolog vector space see hildebrandt 1953 for an axiomat characteris of the integr a number of gener inequ hold for riemann-integr function defin on a close and bound interv a b and can be gener to other notion of integr lebesgu and daniel in thi section f is a real-valu riemann-integr function the integr over an interv a b is defin if a lt b thi mean that the upper and lower sum of the function f are evalu on a partit a x 0 ≤ x 1 ≤ ≤ x n b whose valu x i are increas geometr thi signifi that integr take place `` left to right '' evalu f within interv x i x i +1 where an interv with a higher index lie to the right of one with a lower index the valu a and b the end-point of the interv are call the limit of integr of f integr can also be defin if a gt b thi with a b impli the first convent is necessari in consider of take integr over subinterv of a b the second say that an integr taken over a degener interv or a point should be zero one reason for the first convent is that the integr of f on an interv a b impli that f is integr on ani subinterv c d but in particular integr have the properti that with the first convent the result relat is then well-defin for ani cyclic permut of a b and c the fundament theorem of calculu is the statement that differenti and integr are invers oper if a continu function is first integr and then differenti the origin function is retriev an import consequ sometim call the second fundament theorem of calculu allow one to comput integr by use an antideriv of the function to be integr let f be a continu real-valu function defin on a close interv a b let f be the function defin for all x in a b by then f is continu on a b differenti on the open interv a b and for all x in a b let f be a real-valu function defin on a close interv a b that admit an antideriv f on a b that is f and f are function such that for all x in a b if f is integr on a b then the second fundament theorem allow mani integr to be calcul explicitli for exampl to calcul the integr of the squar root function f x x 1/2 between 0 and 1 it is suffici to find an antideriv that is a function f x whose deriv equal f x one such function is f x 2 3 x 3/2 then the valu of the integr in question is thi is a case of a gener rule that for f x x q with q ≠ −1 the relat function the so-cal antideriv is f x x q 1 q 1 tabl of thi and similar antideriv can be use to calcul integr explicitli in much the same way that tabl of deriv can be use a `` proper '' riemann integr assum the integrand is defin and finit on a close and bound interv bracket by the limit of integr an improp integr occur when one or more of these condit is not satisfi in some case such integr may be defin by consid the limit of a sequenc of proper riemann integr on progress larger interv if the interv is unbound for instanc at it upper end then the improp integr is the limit as that endpoint goe to infin if the integrand is onli defin or finit on a half-open interv for instanc a b then again a limit may provid a finit result that is the improp integr is the limit of proper integr as one endpoint of the interv of integr approach either a specifi real number or ∞ or −∞ in more complic case limit are requir at both endpoint or at interior point just as the definit integr of a posit function of one variabl repres the area of the region between the graph of the function and the x -axi the doubl integr of a posit function of two variabl repres the volum of the region between the surfac defin by the function and the plane that contain it domain for exampl a function in two dimens depend on two real variabl x and y and the integr of a function f over the rectangl r given as the cartesian product of two interv r a b × c d can be written where the differenti da indic that integr is taken with respect to area thi doubl integr can be defin use riemann sum and repres the sign volum under the graph of z f x y over the domain r under suitabl condit e.g. if f is continu then fubini 's theorem guarante that thi integr can be express as an equival iter integr thi reduc the problem of comput a doubl integr to comput one-dimension integr becaus of thi anoth notat for the integr over r use a doubl integr sign integr over more gener domain is possibl the integr of a function f with respect to volum over a subset d of ℝ n is denot by notat such as or similar see volum integr the concept of an integr can be extend to more gener domain of integr such as curv line and surfac such integr are known as line integr and surfac integr respect these have import applic in physic as when deal with vector field a line integr sometim call a path integr is an integr where the function to be integr is evalu along a curv variou differ line integr are in use in the case of a close curv it is also call a contour integr the function to be integr may be a scalar field or a vector field the valu of the line integr is the sum of valu of the field at all point on the curv weight by some scalar function on the curv commonli arc length or for a vector field the scalar product of the vector field with a differenti vector in the curv thi weight distinguish the line integr from simpler integr defin on interv mani simpl formula in physic have natur continu analog in term of line integr for exampl the fact that work is equal to forc f multipli by displac s may be express in term of vector quantiti as for an object move along a path c in a vector field f such as an electr field or gravit field the total work done by the field on the object is obtain by sum up the differenti work done in move from s to s d s thi give the line integr a surfac integr is a definit integr taken over a surfac which may be a curv set in space it can be thought of as the doubl integr analog of the line integr the function to be integr may be a scalar field or a vector field the valu of the surfac integr is the sum of the field at all point on the surfac thi can be achiev by split the surfac into surfac element which provid the partit for riemann sum for an exampl of applic of surfac integr consid a vector field v on a surfac s that is for each point x in s v x is a vector imagin that we have a fluid flow through s such that v x determin the veloc of the fluid at x the flux is defin as the quantiti of fluid flow through s in unit amount of time to find the flux we need to take the dot product of v with the unit surfac normal to s at each point which will give us a scalar field which we integr over the surfac the fluid flux in thi exampl may be from a physic fluid such as water or air or from electr or magnet flux thu surfac integr have applic in physic particularli with the classic theori of electromagnet in complex analysi the integrand is a complex-valu function of a complex variabl z instead of a real function of a real variabl x when a complex function is integr along a curv γ in the complex plane the integr is denot as follow thi is known as a contour integr a differenti form is a mathemat concept in the field of multivari calculu differenti topolog and tensor differenti form are organ by degre for exampl a one-form is a weight sum of the differenti of the coordin such as where e f g are function in three dimens a differenti one-form can be integr over an orient path and the result integr is just anoth way of write a line integr here the basic differenti dx dy dz measur infinitesim orient length parallel to the three coordin axe a differenti two-form is a sum of the form here the basic two-form d x ∧ d y d z ∧ d x d y ∧ d z measur orient area parallel to the coordin two-plan the symbol ∧ denot the wedg product which is similar to the cross product in the sens that the wedg product of two form repres orient length repres an orient area a two-form can be integr over an orient surfac and the result integr is equival to the surfac integr give the flux of e i f j g k \displaystyl e\mathbf +f\mathbf +g\mathbf unlik the cross product and the three-dimension vector calculu the wedg product and the calculu of differenti form make sens in arbitrari dimens and on more gener manifold curv surfac and their higher-dimension analog the exterior deriv play the role of the gradient and curl of vector calculu and stoke theorem simultan gener the three theorem of vector calculu the diverg theorem green 's theorem and the kelvin-stok theorem the discret equival of integr is summat summat and integr can be put on the same foundat use the theori of lebesgu integr or time scale calculu the most basic techniqu for comput definit integr of one real variabl is base on the fundament theorem of calculu let f x be the function of x to be integr over a given interv a b then find an antideriv of f that is a function f such that f ′ f on the interv provid the integrand and integr have no singular on the path of integr by the fundament theorem of calculu the integr is not actual the antideriv but the fundament theorem provid a way to use antideriv to evalu definit integr the most difficult step is usual to find the antideriv of f it is rare possibl to glanc at a function and write down it antideriv more often it is necessari to use one of the mani techniqu that have been develop to evalu integr most of these techniqu rewrit one integr as a differ one which is hope more tractabl techniqu includ altern method exist to comput more complex integr mani nonelementari integr can be expand in a taylor seri and integr term by term occasion the result infinit seri can be sum analyt the method of convolut use meijer g-function can also be use assum that the integrand can be written as a product of meijer g-function there are also mani less common way of calcul definit integr for instanc parsev 's ident can be use to transform an integr over a rectangular region into an infinit sum occasion an integr can be evalu by a trick for an exampl of thi see gaussian integr comput of volum of solid of revolut can usual be done with disk integr or shell integr specif result which have been work out by variou techniqu are collect in the list of integr mani problem in mathemat physic and engin involv integr where an explicit formula for the integr is desir extens tabl of integr have been compil and publish over the year for thi purpos with the spread of comput mani profession educ and student have turn to comput algebra system that are specif design to perform difficult or tediou task includ integr symbol integr ha been one of the motiv for the develop of the first such system like macsyma a major mathemat difficulti in symbol integr is that in mani case a close formula for the antideriv of a rather simple-look function doe not exist for instanc it is known that the antideriv of the function exp x 2 x x and sin x x can not be express in the close form involv onli ration and exponenti function logarithm trigonometr function and invers trigonometr function and the oper of multipl and composit in other word none of the three given function is integr in elementari function which are the function which may be built from ration function root of a polynomi logarithm and exponenti function the risch algorithm provid a gener criterion to determin whether the antideriv of an elementari function is elementari and if it is to comput it unfortun it turn out that function with close express of antideriv are the except rather than the rule consequ computer algebra system have no hope of be abl to find an antideriv for a randomli construct elementari function on the posit side if the 'build block for antideriv are fix in advanc it may be still be possibl to decid whether the antideriv of a given function can be express use these block and oper of multipl and composit and to find the symbol answer whenev it exist the risch algorithm implement in mathematica and other comput algebra system doe just that for function and antideriv built from ration function radic logarithm and exponenti function some special integrand occur often enough to warrant special studi in particular it may be use to have in the set of antideriv the special function like the legendr function the hypergeometr function the gamma function the incomplet gamma function and so on — see symbol integr for more detail extend the risch 's algorithm to includ such function is possibl but challeng and ha been an activ research subject more recent a new approach ha emerg use d -finit function which are the solut of linear differenti equat with polynomi coeffici most of the elementari and special function are d -finit and the integr of a d -finit function is also a d -finit function thi provid an algorithm to express the antideriv of a d -finit function as the solut of a differenti equat thi theori also allow one to comput the definit integr of a d -function as the sum of a seri given by the first coeffici and provid an algorithm to comput ani coeffici some integr found in real applic can be comput by closed-form antideriv other are not so accommod some antideriv do not have close form some close form requir special function that themselv are a challeng to comput and other are so complex that find the exact answer is too slow thi motiv the studi and applic of numer approxim of integr thi subject call numer integr or numer quadratur aros earli in the studi of integr for the purpos of make hand calcul the develop of general-purpos comput made numer integr more practic and drove a desir for improv the goal of

the step width h here 0.25 to get an approxim valu of 3.94325 for the integr the accuraci is not impress but calculu formal use piec of infinitesim width so initi thi may seem littl caus for concern inde repeatedli doubl the number of step eventu produc an approxim of 3.76001 howev 2 18 piec are requir a great comput expens for such littl accuraci and a reach for greater accuraci can forc step so small that arithmet precis becom an obstacl a better approach replac the rectangl use in a riemann sum with trapezoid the trapezoid rule is almost as easi to calcul it sum all 17 function valu but

substanti less comput than the rectangl method for compar accuraci the idea behind the trapezoid rule that more accur approxim to the function yield better approxim to the integr can be carri further simpson 's rule approxim the integrand by a piecewis quadrat function riemann sum the trapezoid rule and simpson 's rule are exampl of a famili of quadratur rule call newton–cot formula the degre n newton–cot quadratur rule approxim the polynomi on each subinterv by a degre n polynomi thi polynomi is chosen to interpol the valu of the function on the interv higher degre newton-cot approxim can be more accur but they requir more function evalu alreadi simpson 's rule requir twice the function evalu of the trapezoid rule and they can suffer from numer inaccuraci due to rung 's phenomenon one solut to thi problem is clenshaw–curti quadratur in which the integrand is approxim by expand it in term of chebyshev polynomi thi produc an approxim whose valu never deviat far from those of the

chosen endpoint are symmetr around zero cancel also benefit the romberg method in practic each method must use extra evalu to ensur an error bound on an unknown function thi tend to offset some of the advantag of the pure gaussian method and motiv the popular gauss–kronrod quadratur formula more broadli adapt quadratur partit a rang into piec base on function properti so that data point are concentr where they are need most the comput of higher-dimension integr for exampl volum calcul make import use of such altern as mont carlo integr a calculu text is no substitut for numer analysi but the revers is also true even the best adapt numer code sometim requir a user to help with the more demand integr for exampl improp integr may requir a chang of variabl or method that can avoid infinit function valu and known properti like symmetri and period may provid critic leverag for exampl the integr ∫ 0 1 x − 1 2 e − x d x \displaystyl \int x^ e^ dx is difficult to evalu numer becaus it is infinit at x 0 howev the substitut u √ x transform the integr into 2 ∫ 0 1 e − u 2 d u \displaystyl 2\int e^ -u^ du which ha no singular at all the area of an arbitrari two-dimension shape can be
