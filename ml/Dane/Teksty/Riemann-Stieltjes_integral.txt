in mathemat the riemann–stieltj integr is a gener of the riemann integr name after bernhard riemann and thoma joann stieltj the definit of thi integr wa first publish in 1894 by stieltj it serv as an instruct and use precursor of the lebesgu integr and an invalu tool in unifi equival form of statist theorem that appli to discret and continu probabl the riemann–stieltj integr of a real -valu function f of a real variabl with respect to a real function g is denot by and defin to be the limit as the norm or mesh of the partit of the interv a b approach zero of the approxim sum where c i is in the i -th subinterv x i x i +1 the two function f and g are respect call the integrand and the integr the `` limit '' is here understood to be a number a the valu of the riemann–stieltj integr such that for everi ε gt 0 there exist δ gt 0 such that for everi partit p with mesh p lt δ and for everi choic of point c i in x i x i +1 a slight gener introduc by pollard 1920 and now standard in analysi is to consid in the abov definit partit p that refin anoth partit p ε mean that p aris from p ε by the addit of point rather than from partit with a finer mesh specif the gener riemann–stieltj integr of f with respect to g is a number a such that for everi ε gt 0 there exist a partit p ε such that for everi partit p that refin p ε for everi choic of point c i in x i x i +1 thi gener exhibit the riemann–stieltj integr as the moore–smith limit on the direct set of partit of a b mcshane 1952 hildebrandt 1938 call it the pollard–moore–stieltj integr the riemann–stieltj integr can be effici handl use an appropri gener of darboux sum for a partit p and a nondecreas function g on a b defin the upper darboux sum of f with respect to g by and the lower sum by then the gener riemann–stieltj of f with respect to g exist if and onli if for everi ε gt 0 there exist a partit p such that furthermor f is riemann–stieltj integr with respect to g in the classic sens if see grave 1946 chap xii §3 if g should happen to be everywher differenti then the riemann–stieltj integr may still be differ from the riemann integr of f x g ′ x given by for exampl if the deriv g ′ is unbound but if the deriv g ′ is continu both integr coincid more gener the riemann integr equal the riemann-stieltj integr if g is the lebesgu integr of it deriv in thi case g is said to be absolut continu howev g may have jump discontinu or may have deriv zero almost everywher while still be continu and increas for exampl g could be the cantor function or devil 's staircas in either of which case the riemann–stieltj integr is not captur by ani express involv deriv of g the riemann–stieltj integr admit integr by part in the form and the exist of either integr impli the exist of the other hill amp phillip 1974 §3.3 the best simpl exist theorem state that if f is continu and g is of bound variat on a b then the integr exist a function g is of bound variat if and onli if it is the differ between two monoton function if g is not of bound variat then there will be continu function which can not be integr with respect to g in gener the integr is not well-defin if f and g share ani point of discontinu but thi suffici condit is not necessari on the other hand a classic result of young 1936 state that the integr is well-defin if f is α hölder continu and g is β -hölder continu with α β gt 1. if g is the cumul probabl distribut function of a random variabl x that ha a probabl densiti function with respect to lebesgu measur and f is ani function for which the expect valu e f x is finit clarif need then the probabl densiti function of x is the deriv of g and we have but thi formula doe not work if x doe not have a probabl densiti function with respect to lebesgu measur in particular it doe not work if the distribut of x is discret i.e. all of the probabl is account for by point-mass and even if the cumul distribut function g is continu it doe not work if g fail to be absolut continu again the cantor function may serv as an exampl of thi failur but the ident hold if g is ani cumul probabl distribut function on the real line no matter how ill-behav in particular no matter how ill-behav the cumul distribut function g of a random variabl x if the moment e x n exist then it is equal to the riemann–stieltj integr appear in the origin formul of f. riesz 's theorem which repres the dual space of the banach space c a b of continu function in an interv a b as riemann–stieltj integr against function of bound variat later that theorem wa reformul in term of measur the riemann–stieltj integr also appear in the formul of the spectral theorem for non-compact self-adjoint or more gener normal oper in a hilbert space in thi theorem the integr is consid with respect to a spectral famili of project see riesz amp sz nagi 1955 for detail an import gener is the lebesgue–stieltj integr which gener the riemann–stieltj integr in a way analog to how the lebesgu integr gener the riemann integr if improp riemann–stieltj integr are allow the lebesgu integr is not strictli more gener than the riemann–stieltj integr the riemann–stieltj integr also gener to the case when either the integrand ƒ or the integr g take valu in a banach space if g a b → x take valu in the banach space x then it is natur to assum that it is of strongli bound variat mean that the supremum be taken over all finit partit of the interv a b thi gener play a role in the studi of semigroup via the laplace–stieltj transform
