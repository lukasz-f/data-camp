       "  <p>The principles of integration were formulated independently by <a href=\"/wiki/Isaac_Newton\" title=\"Isaac Newton\">Isaac Newton</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz\" title=\"Gottfried Leibniz\">Gottfried Leibniz</a> in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of <a href=\"/wiki/Infinitesimal\" title=\"Infinitesimal\">infinitesimal</a> width. A rigorous mathematical definition of the integral was given by <a href=\"/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann\" title=\"Bernhard Riemann\">Bernhard Riemann</a>. It is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Curvilinear\" title=\"Curvilinear\">curvilinear</a> region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the <a href=\"/wiki/Domain_of_a_function\" title=\"Domain of a function\">domain</a> over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A <a href=\"/wiki/Line_integral\" title=\"Line integral\">line integral</a> is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration <span class=\"texhtml\">[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</span> is replaced by a certain <a href=\"/wiki/Curve\" title=\"Curve\">curve</a> connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a <a href=\"/wiki/Surface_integral\" title=\"Surface integral\">surface integral</a>, the curve is replaced by a piece of a <a href=\"/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)\" title=\"Surface (mathematics)\">surface</a> in the three-dimensional space.</p>,\n",

       "  <p></p>,\n",

This method was further developed and employed by <a href=\"/wiki/Archimedes\" title=\"Archimedes\">Archimedes</a> in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for <a href=\"/wiki/Parabola\" title=\"Parabola\">parabolas</a> and an approximation to the area of a circle.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>A similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by <a href=\"/wiki/Liu_Hui\" title=\"Liu Hui\">Liu Hui</a>, who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians <a href=\"/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi\" title=\"Zu Chongzhi\">Zu Chongzhi</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Zu_Geng_(mathematician)\" title=\"Zu Geng (mathematician)\">Zu Geng</a> to find the volume of a sphere (<a href=\"#CITEREFShea2007\">Shea 2007</a>; <a href=\"#CITEREFKatz2004\">Katz 2004</a>, pp. 125–126).</p>,\n",
       "  <p>The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Bonaventura_Cavalieri\" title=\"Bonaventura Cavalieri\">Cavalieri</a> with his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Method_of_Indivisibles\" title=\"Method of Indivisibles\">method of Indivisibles</a>, and work by <a href=\"/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat\" title=\"Pierre de Fermat\">Fermat</a>, began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>x</i><sup><i>n</i></sup></span> up to degree <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>n</i> = 9</span> in <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_quadrature_formula\" title=\"Cavalieri's quadrature formula\">Cavalieri's quadrature formula</a>. Further steps were made in the early 17th century by <a href=\"/wiki/Isaac_Barrow\" title=\"Isaac Barrow\">Barrow</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli\" title=\"Evangelista Torricelli\">Torricelli</a>, who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and <a href=\"/wiki/Differential_calculus\" title=\"Differential calculus\">differentiation</a>. Barrow provided the first proof of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus\" title=\"Fundamental theorem of calculus\">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/John_Wallis\" title=\"John Wallis\">Wallis</a> generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">x</span> to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus\" title=\"Fundamental theorem of calculus\">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Isaac_Newton\" title=\"Isaac Newton\">Newton</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz\" title=\"Gottfried Leibniz\">Leibniz</a>. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern <a href=\"/wiki/Calculus\" title=\"Calculus\">calculus</a>, whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Rigor#Mathematical_rigour\" title=\"Rigor\">rigour</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/George_Berkeley\" title=\"George Berkeley\">Bishop Berkeley</a> memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them \"<a href=\"/wiki/The_Analyst#Content\" title=\"The Analyst\">ghosts of departed quantities</a>\". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of <a href=\"/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)\" title=\"Limit (mathematics)\">limits</a>. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by <a href=\"/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann\" title=\"Bernhard Riemann\">Riemann</a>. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of <a href=\"/wiki/Fourier_analysis\" title=\"Fourier analysis\">Fourier analysis</a>—to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and <a href=\"/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue\" title=\"Henri Lebesgue\">Lebesgue</a> formulated a different definition of integral, founded in <a href=\"/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)\" title=\"Measure (mathematics)\">measure theory</a> (a subfield of <a href=\"/wiki/Real_analysis\" title=\"Real analysis\">real analysis</a>). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Standard_part\" title=\"Standard part\">standard part</a> of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Hyperreal_number\" title=\"Hyperreal number\">hyperreal number</a> system.</p>,\n",
       "  <p><a href=\"/wiki/Isaac_Newton\" title=\"Isaac Newton\">Isaac Newton</a> used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with <span class=\"texhtml\"><span class=\"sfrac nowrap;\"><span style=\"display:none; display:inline-block; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"display:block; line-height:0.8em; font-size:70%; padding:0 0.1em;\"><b>.</b></span><span style=\"display:block; line-height:1em; padding:0 0.1em;\"><i>x</i></span></span></span></span> or <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>x</i>′</span>, which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>The modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz\" title=\"Gottfried Leibniz\">Gottfried Leibniz</a> in 1675 (<a href=\"#CITEREFBurton1988\">Burton 1988</a>, p. 359; <a href=\"#CITEREFLeibniz1899\">Leibniz 1899</a>, p. 154).

The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Fourier\" title=\"Joseph Fourier\">Joseph Fourier</a> in <i>Mémoires</i> of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in his book of 1822 (<a href=\"#CITEREFCajori1929\">Cajori 1929</a>, pp. 249–250; <a href=\"#CITEREFFourier1822\">Fourier 1822</a>, §231).</p>,\n",

In more sophisticated contexts, <i>dx</i> can have its own significance, the meaning of which depending on the particular area of mathematics in question. The original Leibnitz notation was co-opted in various efforts to make precise and extend the definition of the integral to increasingly general scenarios, giving rise to several distinct usages.

However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral.

Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The <a href=\"/wiki/Risch_algorithm\" title=\"Risch algorithm\">Risch algorithm</a>, implemented in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Mathematica\" title=\"Mathematica\">Mathematica</a> and other <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_algebra_system\" title=\"Computer algebra system\">computer algebra systems</a>, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions, <a href=\"/wiki/Nth_root\" title=\"Nth root\">radicals</a>, logarithm, and exponential functions.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the <a href=\"/wiki/Special_functions\" title=\"Special functions\">special functions</a> (like the <a href=\"/wiki/Legendre_function\" title=\"Legendre function\">Legendre functions</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Hypergeometric_function\" title=\"Hypergeometric function\">hypergeometric function</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Gamma_function\" title=\"Gamma function\">gamma function</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function\" title=\"Incomplete gamma function\">incomplete gamma function</a> and so on — see <a href=\"/wiki/Symbolic_integration\" title=\"Symbolic integration\">Symbolic integration</a> for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>More recently a new approach has emerged, using <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/D-finite_function\" title=\"D-finite function\"><i>D</i>-finite functions</a>, which are the solutions of <a href=\"/wiki/Linear_differential_equation\" title=\"Linear differential equation\">linear differential equations</a> with polynomial coefficients.

       "  <p>This theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a <i>D</i>-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>Some integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives. Others are not so accommodating. Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called <i>numerical integration</i> or <i>numerical quadrature</i>, arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures (<a href=\"#CITEREFDahlquistBj.C3.B6rck2008\">Dahlquist &amp; Björck 2008</a>; <a href=\"#CITEREFKahanerMolerNash1989\">Kahaner, Moler &amp; Nash 1989</a>; <a href=\"#CITEREFStoerBulirsch2002\">Stoer &amp; Bulirsch 2002</a>).</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Consider, for example, the integral</p>,\n",
       "  <p>which has the exact answer <span class=\"nowrap\">94/25 = 3.76</span>. (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task — not explored here — is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Using the left end of each piece, the <a href=\"/wiki/Rectangle_method\" title=\"Rectangle method\">rectangle method</a> sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width, <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">h</span>, here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2<sup>18</sup> pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>A better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Trapezoid_rule\" title=\"Trapezoid rule\">trapezoid rule</a> is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2<sup>10</sup> pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. <a href=\"/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule\" title=\"Simpson's rule\">Simpson's rule</a> approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called <a href=\"/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas\" title=\"Newton–Cotes formulas\">Newton–Cotes formulas</a>. The degree <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>n</i></span> Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>n</i></span> polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to <a href=\"/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon\" title=\"Runge's phenomenon\">Runge's phenomenon</a>. One solution to this problem is <a href=\"/wiki/Clenshaw%E2%80%93Curtis_quadrature\" title=\"Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature\">Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature</a>, in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of <a href=\"/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials\" title=\"Chebyshev polynomials\">Chebyshev polynomials</a>.

       "  <p><a href=\"/wiki/Romberg%27s_method\" title=\"Romberg's method\">Romberg's method</a> builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>T</i>(<i>h</i><sub>0</sub>), <i>T</i>(<i>h</i><sub>1</sub>)</span>, and so on, where <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i><sub><i>k</i>+1</sub></span> is half of <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></span>. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to <a href=\"/wiki/Interpolation\" title=\"Interpolation\">interpolate</a> a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>T</i>(0)</span>. With this method a numerically <i>exact</i> answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The <a href=\"/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial\" title=\"Lagrange polynomial\">Lagrange polynomial</a> interpolating <span class=\"texhtml\">{<i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>,<i>T</i>(<i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>)}<sub><i>k</i> = 0...2</sub> =</span> {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148<span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i><sup>2</sup></span>, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i> = 0</span>.</p>,\n",
       "  <p><a href=\"/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature\" title=\"Gaussian quadrature\">Gaussian quadrature</a> often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">x</span> positions, <span class=\"texhtml\">±2 ⁄ <span class=\"nowrap\">√<span style=\"border-top:1px solid; padding:0 0.1em;\">3</span></span></span>, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton–Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomial\" title=\"Orthogonal polynomial\">orthogonal polynomials</a>. An <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">n</span>-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to <span class=\"texhtml\">2<i>n</i> − 1</span>. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)</p>,\n",
       "  <p>In practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular <a href=\"/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Kronrod_quadrature_formula\" title=\"Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula\">Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formulae</a>.

       "  <p>For all <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>ε</i> &gt; 0</span>, there exists a tagged partition <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>y</i><sub>0</sub>, ..., <i>y<sub>m</sub></i></span> and <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>r</i><sub>0</sub>, ..., <i>r</i><sub><i>m</i> − 1</sub></span> such that for any tagged partition <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, ..., <i>x<sub>n</sub></i></span> and <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>t</i><sub>0</sub>, ..., <i>t</i><sub><i>n</i> − 1</sub></span> which is a refinement of <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>y</i><sub>0</sub>, ..., <i>y<sub>m</sub></i></span> and <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>r</i><sub>0</sub>, ..., <i>r</i><sub><i>m</i> − 1</sub></span>, we have</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Both of these mean that eventually, the Riemann sum of <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">f</span> with respect to any partition gets trapped close to <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">s</span>.

       "  <p>Our first step is to cut up the partition.

       "  <p>Now we add two cuts to the partition for each <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">t<sub>i</sub></span>.

       "  <p>Since we started from an arbitrary partition and ended up as close as we wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">s</span>, so this function is not Riemann integrable.

       "  <p>There are even worse examples. <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>I</i><sub><b>Q</b></sub></span> is equivalent (that is, equal almost everywhere) to a Riemann integrable function, but there are non-Riemann integrable bounded functions which are not equivalent to any Riemann integrable function. For example, let <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">C</span> be the <a href=\"/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Volterra%E2%80%93Cantor_set\" title=\"Smith–Volterra–Cantor set\">Smith–Volterra–Cantor set</a>, and let <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>I</i><sub><i>C</i></sub></span> be its indicator function.

       "  <p>Some calculus books do not use general tagged partitions, but limit themselves to specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions may appear to be integrable.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>One popular restriction is the use of \"left-hand\" and \"right-hand\" Riemann sums.

Alone this restriction does not impose a problem: we can refine any partition in a way that makes it a left-hand or right-hand sum by subdividing it at each <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">t<sub>i</sub></span>. In more formal language, the set of all left-hand Riemann sums and the set of all right-hand Riemann sums is <a href=\"/wiki/Cofinal_(mathematics)\" title=\"Cofinal (mathematics)\">cofinal</a> in the set of all tagged partitions.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Another popular restriction is the use of regular subdivisions of an interval. For example, the <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">n</span>th regular subdivision of <span class=\"texhtml\">[0, 1]</span> consists of the intervals</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Again, alone this restriction does not impose a problem, but the reasoning required to see this fact is more difficult than in the case of left-hand and right-hand Riemann sums.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>However, combining these restrictions, so that one uses only left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums on regularly divided intervals, is dangerous.

The problem with this definition becomes apparent when we try to split the integral into two pieces. The following equation ought to hold:</p>,\n",
       "  <p>If we use regular subdivisions and left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums, then the two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1.</p>,\n",

The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once. That is, for any vector <b>v</b> starting at <b>a</b>, the linear approximation formula holds:</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Just like the single-variable derivative, <span class=\"nowrap\"><i>f</i> ′(<b>a</b>)</span> is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.</p>,\n",

       "  <p>If we assume that <b>v</b> is small and that the derivative varies continuously in <b>a</b>, then <span class=\"nowrap\"><i>f</i> ′(<b>a</b> + <b>v</b>)</span> is approximately equal to <span class=\"nowrap\"><i>f</i> ′(<b>a</b>)</span>, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with <span class=\"nowrap\"><b>v</b> + <b>w</b></span> substituted for <b>v</b>. The linear approximation formula implies:</p>,\n",
       "  <p>This suggests that <span class=\"nowrap\"><i>f</i> ′(<b>a</b>)</span> is a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Linear_transformation\" title=\"Linear transformation\">linear transformation</a> from the vector space <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> to the vector space <b>R</b><sup><i>m</i></sup>.

Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities. In particular, <span class=\"nowrap\"><i>f</i> ′(<b>a</b>)</span> is a linear transformation up to a small error term. In the limit as <b>v</b> and <b>w</b> tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation.

       "  <p>In one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.

Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator. To make precise the idea that <span class=\"nowrap\"><i>f</i> ′(<b>a</b>)</span> is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear.

Some early works are reminiscent of <a href=\"/wiki/%C3%89douard_Manet\" title=\"Édouard Manet\">Manet</a>.

He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jæger's commandment that Munch should \"write his life\", meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his \"soul's diary\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup> This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Sick_Child\" title=\"The Sick Child\">The Sick Child</a></i> (1886), based on his sister's death, was his first \"soul painting\", his first break from Impressionism.

For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule \"not complete\", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-22\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]</a></sup></p>,\n",

Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in <i>Ashes</i>, the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munch's figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage (<i>Death in the Sick-Room</i>), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in <i>The Scream</i>, Munch's men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic.

Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as <i>Rose and Amelie</i> and <i>Vampire</i>. In <i>Death in the Sickroom</i>, the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding <i>Anxiety</i>, <i>Ashes</i>, <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Madonna_(Edvard_Munch)\" title=\"Madonna (Edvard Munch)\">Madonna</a></i> and <i>Women in Three Stages</i> (from innocence to old age).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-52\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">[52]</a></sup></p>,\n",

He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting <i>Metabolism</i> (1898), initially called <i>Adam and Eve</i>. This work reveals Munch's preoccupation with the \"fall of man\" and his pessimistic philosophy of love.

The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Puberty_(Edvard_Munch)\" title=\"Puberty (Edvard Munch)\">Puberty</a></i> and <i>Love and Pain</i>) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see <i>Separation</i>, <i>Jealousy</i>, and <i>Ashes</i>).</p>,\n",

He dubbed this home the \"Happy House\" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Eg_p153_62-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eg_p153-62\">[62]</a></sup> It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. \"To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here\".</p>,\n",
       "  <p>In 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, \"A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Eg_p153_62-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eg_p153-62\">[62]</a></sup> In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in \"The Frieze of Life\" series, <i>The Dance of Life</i> (1899).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-64\"><a href=\"#cite_note-64\">[64]</a></sup> Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: \"Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Eg_p174_65-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eg_p174-65\">[65]</a></sup> Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Eg_p174_65-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eg_p174-65\">[65]</a></sup> His <i>Girls on the Jetty</i>, created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Fa_p5_57-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Fa_p5-57\">[57]</a></sup> In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing \"a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-66\"><a href=\"#cite_note-66\">[66]</a></sup> The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>The good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and <a href=\"/wiki/Max_Linde\" title=\"Max Linde\">Max Linde</a>. He described the turn of events in his diary, \"After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-67\"><a href=\"#cite_note-67\">[67]</a></sup> However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-68\"><a href=\"#cite_note-68\">[68]</a></sup> His paintings <i>Still Life (The Murderess)</i> and <i>The Death of Marat I</i>, done in 1906-7, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-69\"><a href=\"#cite_note-69\">[69]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>In 1903-4, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming <a href=\"/wiki/Fauvism\" title=\"Fauvism\">Fauvists</a>, famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-70\"><a href=\"#cite_note-70\">[70]</a></sup> After studying the sculpture of <a href=\"/wiki/Auguste_Rodin\" title=\"Auguste Rodin\">Rodin</a>, Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-71\"><a href=\"#cite_note-71\">[71]</a></sup> During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-72\"><a href=\"#cite_note-72\">[72]</a></sup> In 1906, he painted the screen for an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Ibsen\" title=\"Ibsen\">Ibsen</a> play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's <a href=\"/wiki/Deutsches_Theater_(Berlin)\" title=\"Deutsches Theater (Berlin)\">Deutsches Theater</a>, in which the <i>Frieze of Life</i> was hung.

       "  <p>In the autumn of 1908, Munch's anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Psychotherapy\" title=\"Psychotherapy\">therapy</a> Munch received for the next eight months included diet and \"electrification\" (a treatment then fashionable for nervous conditions, not to be confused with <a href=\"/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy\" title=\"Electroconvulsive therapy\">electroconvulsive therapy</a>).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-76\"><a href=\"#cite_note-76\">[76]</a></sup> Munch's stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic. Further brightening his mood, the general public of Kristiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings. He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St. Olav \"for services in art\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-77\"><a href=\"#cite_note-77\">[77]</a></sup> His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-78\"><a href=\"#cite_note-78\">[78]</a></sup></p>,\n",

Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-79\"><a href=\"#cite_note-79\">[79]</a></sup> He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-80\"><a href=\"#cite_note-80\">[80]</a></sup></p>,\n",

       "  <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a <a href=\"/wiki/Protestantism\" title=\"Protestantism\">Protestant</a> missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother <a href=\"/wiki/Theo_van_Gogh_(art_dealer)\" title=\"Theo van Gogh (art dealer)\">Theo</a> supported him financially, and the two kept up a <a href=\"/wiki/The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh\" title=\"The Letters of Vincent van Gogh\">long correspondence by letter</a>.

In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Avant-garde\" title=\"Avant-garde\">avant-garde</a></i>, including <a href=\"/wiki/%C3%89mile_Bernard\" title=\"Émile Bernard\">Émile Bernard</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Paul_Gauguin\" title=\"Paul Gauguin\">Paul Gauguin</a>, who were reacting against the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Impressionist\" title=\"Impressionist\">Impressionist</a> sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and <a href=\"/wiki/Montmartre_(Van_Gogh_series)\" title=\"Montmartre (Van Gogh series)\">local landscapes</a>. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in <a href=\"/wiki/Arles\" title=\"Arles\">Arles</a> in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include <a href=\"/wiki/Olive_Trees_(Van_Gogh_series)\" title=\"Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)\">olive trees</a>, cypresses, <a href=\"/wiki/Wheat_Fields_(Van_Gogh_series)\" title=\"Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)\">wheat fields</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)\" title=\"Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)\">sunflowers</a>.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at <a href=\"/wiki/Saint-R%C3%A9my-de-Provence\" title=\"Saint-Rémy-de-Provence\">Saint-Rémy</a>.

His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcQuillan19899_7-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcQuillan19899-7\">[6]</a></sup> His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Fauvism\" title=\"Fauvism\">Fauves</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/German_Expressionism\" title=\"German Expressionism\">German Expressionists</a>.

       "  <p>In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Confession\" title=\"A Confession\">A Confession</a></i>. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the <a href=\"/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount\" title=\"Sermon on the Mount\">Sermon on the Mount</a>, caused him to become a fervent <a href=\"/wiki/Christian_anarchism\" title=\"Christian anarchism\">Christian anarchist</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Anarcho-pacifist\" title=\"Anarcho-pacifist\">pacifist</a>.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Tolstoy_family\" title=\"Tolstoy family\">Tolstoys</a> were a well-known family of old <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_nobility\" title=\"Russian nobility\">Russian nobility</a>, tracing their ancestry to a noble named Indris from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Lithuanian-Polish_commonwealth\" title=\"Lithuanian-Polish commonwealth\">Lithuanian empire</a> in 1353.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> He was the fourth of five children of <a href=\"/wiki/Count\" title=\"Count\">Count</a> Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy, a veteran of the <a href=\"/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia\" title=\"French invasion of Russia\">Patriotic War of 1812</a>, and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (Volkonskaya). Tolstoy's parents died when he was young, so he and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Kazan_University\" title=\"Kazan University\">Kazan University</a>. His teachers described him as \"both unable and unwilling to learn.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much of his time in Moscow and <a href=\"/wiki/Saint_Petersburg\" title=\"Saint Petersburg\">Saint Petersburg</a>. In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Caucasus_(geographic_region)\" title=\"Caucasus (geographic region)\">Caucasus</a> and joined the <a href=\"/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army\" title=\"Imperial Russian Army\">army</a>. It was about this time that he started writing.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>His conversion from a dissolute and privileged society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his latter days was brought about by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed the same path were <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Herzen\" title=\"Alexander Herzen\">Alexander Herzen</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin\" title=\"Mikhail Bakunin\">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin\" title=\"Peter Kropotkin\">Peter Kropotkin</a>. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that would mark the rest of his life. Writing in a letter to his friend <a href=\"/wiki/Vasily_Botkin\" title=\"Vasily Botkin\">Vasily Botkin</a>: \"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> Tolstoy's concept of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Non-violence\" title=\"Non-violence\">non-violence</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Ahimsa\" title=\"Ahimsa\">Ahimsa</a> was bolstered when he read a <a href=\"/wiki/German_language\" title=\"German language\">German</a> version of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Tirukkural\" title=\"Tirukkural\">Tirukkural</a>. He later instilled the concept in <a href=\"/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi\" title=\"Mahatma Gandhi\">Mahatma Gandhi</a> through his <a href=\"/wiki/A_Letter_to_a_Hindu\" title=\"A Letter to a Hindu\">A Letter to a Hindu</a> when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-PearlsOfInsp_Rajaram_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PearlsOfInsp_Rajaram-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>His European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met <a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Hugo\" title=\"Victor Hugo\">Victor Hugo</a>, whose literary talents Tolstoy praised after reading Hugo's newly finished <i><a href=\"/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables\" title=\"Les Misérables\">Les Misérables</a></i>. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's <i><a href=\"/wiki/War_and_Peace\" title=\"War and Peace\">War and Peace</a></i> indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist <a href=\"/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon\" title=\"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Apart from reviewing Proudhon's forthcoming publication, <i>La Guerre et la Paix</i> (<i>War and Peace</i> in French), whose title Tolstoy would borrow for his masterpiece, the two men discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\"</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for children of Russia's peasants, who had just been <a href=\"/wiki/Emancipation_reform_of_1861\" title=\"Emancipation reform of 1861\">emancipated from serfdom in 1861</a>. Tolstoy described the school's principles in his 1862 essay \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived, partly due to harassment by the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Empire\" title=\"Russian Empire\">Tsarist</a> secret police. However, as a direct forerunner to <a href=\"/wiki/A._S._Neill\" title=\"A. S. Neill\">A. S.

       "  <p>On September 23, 1862, Tolstoy married <a href=\"/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya\" title=\"Sophia Tolstaya\">Sophia Andreevna Behrs</a>, who was 16 years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-nyt_11-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nyt-11\">[11]</a></sup> They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>The marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-nyt_11-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nyt-11\">[11]</a></sup> Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom to compose <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i> with Sonya acting as his secretary, proofreader and financial manager.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-nyt_11-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nyt-11\">[11]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>However, their later life together has been described by <a href=\"/wiki/A._N._Wilson\" title=\"A. N. Wilson\">A. N. Wilson</a> as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>The Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the <a href=\"/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution\" title=\"1905 Russian Revolution\">1905 Russian Revolution</a> and the subsequent establishment of the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>, and Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States.

       "  <p>Tolstoy is one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels <i><a href=\"/wiki/War_and_Peace\" title=\"War and Peace\">War and Peace</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Anna_Karenina\" title=\"Anna Karenina\">Anna Karenina</a></i> and novellas such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hadji_Murat_(novel)\" title=\"Hadji Murat (novel)\">Hadji Murad</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich\" title=\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a></i>. His contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. <a href=\"/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky\" title=\"Fyodor Dostoyevsky\">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a> thought him the greatest of all living novelists. <a href=\"/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert\" title=\"Gustave Flaubert\">Gustave Flaubert</a>, on reading a translation of <i>War and Peace</i>, exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\" <a href=\"/wiki/Anton_Chekhov\" title=\"Anton Chekhov\">Anton Chekhov</a>, who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic <a href=\"/wiki/Matthew_Arnold\" title=\"Matthew Arnold\">Matthew Arnold</a> opined that \"a novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Tolstoy.2C_Leo_2014_13-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tolstoy.2C_Leo_2014-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>,\n",

Such sentiments were shared by the likes of <a href=\"/wiki/Marcel_Proust\" title=\"Marcel Proust\">Proust</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/William_Faulkner\" title=\"William Faulkner\">Faulkner</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov\" title=\"Vladimir Nabokov\">Nabokov</a>. The latter heaped superlatives upon <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich\" title=\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a></i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>; he questioned, however, the reputation of <i>War and Peace</i>, and sharply criticized <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resurrection_(novel)\" title=\"Resurrection (novel)\">Resurrection</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Kreutzer_Sonata\" title=\"The Kreutzer Sonata\">The Kreutzer Sonata</a></i>.</p>,\n",

Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.</p>,\n",
       "  <p>Tolstoy served as a <a href=\"/wiki/Second_lieutenant\" title=\"Second lieutenant\">second lieutenant</a> in an artillery regiment during the <a href=\"/wiki/Crimean_War\" title=\"Crimean War\">Crimean War</a>, recounted in his <i><a href=\"/wiki/Sevastopol_Sketches\" title=\"Sevastopol Sketches\">Sevastopol Sketches</a></i>. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent <a href=\"/wiki/Pacifism\" title=\"Pacifism\">pacifism</a> and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></sup> <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Cossacks_(novel)\" title=\"The Cossacks (novel)\">The Cossacks</a></i> (1863) describes the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Cossack\" title=\"Cossack\">Cossack</a> life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. <i>Anna Karenina</i> (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in <i>War and Peace</i>, Levin in <i>Anna Karenina</i> and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in <i>Resurrection</i>.</p>,\n",
       "  <p><i>War and Peace</i> is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France\" title=\"Napoleon I of France\">Napoleon</a>, from the court of <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia\" title=\"Alexander I of Russia\">Alexander I of Russia</a> to the battlefields of <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz\" title=\"Battle of Austerlitz\">Austerlitz</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Borodino\" title=\"Battle of Borodino\">Borodino</a>. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the <a href=\"/wiki/Decembrist_revolt\" title=\"Decembrist revolt\">Decembrist revolt</a>, to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that <a href=\"/wiki/Andrei_Nikolayevich_Bolkonsky\" title=\"Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky\">Andrei Bolkonsky</a>'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider <i>War and Peace</i> to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the <a href=\"/wiki/Realism_(arts)\" title=\"Realism (arts)\">realist</a> school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup> <i>War and Peace</i> (which is to Tolstoy really an <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_poetry\" title=\"Epic poetry\">epic</a> in prose) therefore did not qualify.

       "  <p>After <i>Anna Karenina</i>, Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i> (1886) and <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/What_Is_to_Be_Done%3F_(Tolstoy)\" title=\"What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)\">What Is to Be Done?</a></i> develop a radical <a href=\"/wiki/Anarcho-pacifism\" title=\"Anarcho-pacifism\">anarcho-pacifist</a> Christian philosophy which led to his <a href=\"/wiki/Excommunication\" title=\"Excommunication\">excommunication</a> from the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church\" title=\"Russian Orthodox Church\">Russian Orthodox Church</a> in 1901.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup> For all the praise showered on <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>War and Peace</i>, Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-19\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]</a></sup></p>,\n",
       "  <p>In his novel <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resurrection_(novel)\" title=\"Resurrection (novel)\">Resurrection</a></i>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Tolstoy\" title=\"Tolstoy\">Tolstoy</a> attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church.

       "  <p>After reading <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer\" title=\"Arthur Schopenhauer\">Schopenhauer</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation\" title=\"The World as Will and Representation\">The World as Will and Representation</a></i>, Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me?

       "  <p>In Chapter VI of <i><a href=\"/wiki/A_Confession\" title=\"A Confession\">A Confession</a></i>, Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explained how the nothingness that results from complete <a href=\"/wiki/Self-denial\" title=\"Self-denial\">denial of self</a> is only a relative nothingness, and is not to be feared.

He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-26\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]</a></sup></p>,\n",

In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains.

Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Standard_part\" title=\"Standard part\">standard part</a> of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Hyperreal_number\" title=\"Hyperreal number\">hyperreal number</a> system.</p>,\n",

However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral.

       " <p>A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist.

The <a href=\"/wiki/Risch_algorithm\" title=\"Risch algorithm\">Risch algorithm</a> provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The <a href=\"/wiki/Risch_algorithm\" title=\"Risch algorithm\">Risch algorithm</a>, implemented in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Mathematica\" title=\"Mathematica\">Mathematica</a> and other <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_algebra_system\" title=\"Computer algebra system\">computer algebra systems</a>, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions, <a href=\"/wiki/Nth_root\" title=\"Nth root\">radicals</a>, logarithm, and exponential functions.</p>,\n",

Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called <i>numerical integration</i> or <i>numerical quadrature</i>, arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures (<a href=\"#CITEREFDahlquistBj.C3.B6rck2008\">Dahlquist &amp; Björck 2008</a>; <a href=\"#CITEREFKahanerMolerNash1989\">Kahaner, Moler &amp; Nash 1989</a>; <a href=\"#CITEREFStoerBulirsch2002\">Stoer &amp; Bulirsch 2002</a>).</p>,\n",
       " <p>Consider, for example, the integral</p>,\n",
       " <p>which has the exact answer <span class=\"nowrap\">94/25 = 3.76</span>. (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task — not explored here — is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Using the left end of each piece, the <a href=\"/wiki/Rectangle_method\" title=\"Rectangle method\">rectangle method</a> sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width, <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">h</span>, here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2<sup>18</sup> pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.</p>,\n",
       " <p>A better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Trapezoid_rule\" title=\"Trapezoid rule\">trapezoid rule</a> is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2<sup>10</sup> pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. <a href=\"/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule\" title=\"Simpson's rule\">Simpson's rule</a> approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called <a href=\"/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas\" title=\"Newton–Cotes formulas\">Newton–Cotes formulas</a>. The degree <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>n</i></span> Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>n</i></span> polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to <a href=\"/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon\" title=\"Runge's phenomenon\">Runge's phenomenon</a>. One solution to this problem is <a href=\"/wiki/Clenshaw%E2%80%93Curtis_quadrature\" title=\"Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature\">Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature</a>, in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of <a href=\"/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials\" title=\"Chebyshev polynomials\">Chebyshev polynomials</a>.

       " <p><a href=\"/wiki/Romberg%27s_method\" title=\"Romberg's method\">Romberg's method</a> builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>T</i>(<i>h</i><sub>0</sub>), <i>T</i>(<i>h</i><sub>1</sub>)</span>, and so on, where <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i><sub><i>k</i>+1</sub></span> is half of <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></span>. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to <a href=\"/wiki/Interpolation\" title=\"Interpolation\">interpolate</a> a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>T</i>(0)</span>. With this method a numerically <i>exact</i> answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The <a href=\"/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial\" title=\"Lagrange polynomial\">Lagrange polynomial</a> interpolating <span class=\"texhtml\">{<i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>,<i>T</i>(<i>h</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>)}<sub><i>k</i> = 0...2</sub> =</span> {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148<span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i><sup>2</sup></span>, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at <span class=\"texhtml\"><i>h</i> = 0</span>.</p>,\n",
       " <p><a href=\"/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature\" title=\"Gaussian quadrature\">Gaussian quadrature</a> often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">x</span> positions, <span class=\"texhtml\">±2 ⁄ <span class=\"nowrap\">√<span style=\"border-top:1px solid; padding:0 0.1em;\">3</span></span></span>, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton–Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomial\" title=\"Orthogonal polynomial\">orthogonal polynomials</a>. An <span class=\"texhtml mvar\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">n</span>-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to <span class=\"texhtml\">2<i>n</i> − 1</span>. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)</p>,\n",
       " <p>In practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular <a href=\"/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Kronrod_quadrature_formula\" title=\"Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula\">Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formulae</a>.

       "['[ In  mathematics , an  integral  assigns numbers to functions in a way that can describe displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. Integration is one of the two main operations of  calculus , with its inverse,  differentiation , being the other. Given a  function   f  of a  real   variable   x  and an  interval   [ a ,  b ]  of the  real line , the  definite integral  ,  is defined informally as the signed  area  of the region in the  xy -plane that is bounded by the  graph  of  f , the  x -axis and the vertical lines   x  =  a   and   x  =  b  . The area above the  x -axis adds to the total and that below the  x -axis subtracts from the total. ,  Roughly speaking, the operation of integration is the reverse of differentiation. For this reason, the term  integral  may also refer to the related notion of the  antiderivative , a function  F  whose  derivative  is the given function  f . In this case, it is called an   indefinite integral   and is written: ,  The integrals discussed in this article are those termed  definite integrals . It is the  fundamental theorem of calculus  that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if  f  is a continuous real-valued function defined on a  closed interval   [ a ,  b ] , then, once an antiderivative  F  of  f  is known, the definite integral of  f  over that interval is given by ,  The principles of integration were formulated independently by  Isaac Newton  and  Gottfried Leibniz  in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of  infinitesimal  width. A rigorous mathematical definition of the integral was given by  Bernhard Riemann . It is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a  curvilinear  region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the  domain  over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A  line integral  is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration  [ a ,  b ]  is replaced by a certain  curve  connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a  surface integral , the curve is replaced by a piece of a  surface  in the three-dimensional space. ,   ,   ,  The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the  method of exhaustion  of the  ancient Greek  astronomer  Eudoxus  ( ca.  370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by  Archimedes  in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for  parabolas  and an approximation to the area of a circle. ,  A similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by  Liu Hui , who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians  Zu Chongzhi  and  Zu Geng  to find the volume of a sphere ( Shea 2007 ;  Katz 2004 , pp.\\xa0125–126). ,  The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of  Cavalieri  with his  method of Indivisibles , and work by  Fermat , began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of   x   n    up to degree   n  = 9  in  Cavalieri\\'s quadrature formula . Further steps were made in the early 17th century by  Barrow  and  Torricelli , who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and  differentiation . Barrow provided the first proof of the  fundamental theorem of calculus .  Wallis  generalized Cavalieri\\'s method, computing integrals of  x  to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers. ,  The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the  fundamental theorem of calculus  by  Newton  and  Leibniz . The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern  calculus , whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz. ,  While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of  rigour .  Bishop Berkeley  memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them \" ghosts of departed quantities \". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of  limits . Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by  Riemann . Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of  Fourier analysis —to which Riemann\\'s definition does not apply, and  Lebesgue  formulated a different definition of integral, founded in  measure theory  (a subfield of  real analysis ). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann\\'s and Lebesgue\\'s approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the  standard part  of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the  hyperreal number  system. ,   Isaac Newton  used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with      .    x      or   x ′ , which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted. ,  The modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by  Gottfried Leibniz  in 1675 ( Burton 1988 , p.\\xa0359;  Leibniz 1899 , p.\\xa0154). He adapted the  integral symbol ,  ∫ , from the letter  ſ  ( long s ), standing for  summa  (written as  ſumma ; Latin for \"sum\" or \"total\"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by  Joseph Fourier  in  Mémoires  of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in his book of 1822 ( Cajori 1929 , pp.\\xa0249–250;  Fourier 1822 , §231). ,  The integral with respect to  x  of a  real-valued function    f ( x )  of a real variable  x  on the interval  [ a ,  b ]  is written as ,  The integral sign  ∫  represents integration. The symbol  dx , called the  differential  of the variable  x , indicates that the variable of integration is  x . The function   f ( x )  to be integrated is called the integrand. The symbol  dx  is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown). If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The points  a  and  b  are called the limits of the integral. An integral where the limits are specified is called a definite integral. The integral is said to be over the interval  [ a ,  b ] . ,  When the limits are omitted, as in ,  the integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the  antiderivative ) whose derivative is the integrand. The  fundamental theorem of calculus  relates the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. Occasionally, limits of integration are omitted for definite integrals when the same limits occur repeatedly in a particular context. Usually, the author will make this convention clear at the beginning of the relevant text. ,  There are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article). ,  Historically, the symbol  dx  was taken to represent an infinitesimally \"small piece\" of the independent variable  x  to be multiplied by the integrand and summed up in an infinite sense. While this notion is still heuristically useful, later mathematicians have deemed infinitesimal quantities to be untenable from the standpoint of the real number system.  [1]   In introductory calculus, the expression  dx  is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is viewed as part of the symbol for integration and serves as its delimiter. In more sophisticated contexts,  dx  can have its own significance, the meaning of which depending on the particular area of mathematics in question. The original Leibnitz notation was co-opted in various efforts to make precise and extend the definition of the integral to increasingly general scenarios, giving rise to several distinct usages. Some common interpretations of  dx  include: an integrator function in  Riemann-Stieltjes integration  (indicated by  dα ( x ) in general), a  measure  in Lebesgue theory (indicated by  dμ  in general), or a  differential form  in exterior calculus (indicated by    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n i \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ∧  \\n ⋯  \\n ∧  \\n d \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n i \\n \\n k \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle dx^{i_{1}}\\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}} \\n \\n     in general). In the latter, even the letter  d  has an independent meaning — as the  exterior derivative  operator on forms. Moreover, in advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out  dx  when only the simple Riemann integral is being used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n b \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n c \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n f \\n + \\n \\n c \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n g \\n ) \\n = \\n \\n c \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n b \\n \\n \\n f \\n + \\n \\n c \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n b \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n {\\\\textstyle \\\\int _{a}^{b}(c_{1}f+c_{2}g)=c_{1}\\\\int _{a}^{b}f+c_{2}\\\\int _{a}^{b}g} \\n \\n     to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof. ,  In  modern Arabic mathematical notation , a reflected integral symbol     is used instead of the symbol  ∫ , since the Arabic script and mathematical expressions go right to left.  [2]   Some authors, particularly of European origin, use an upright \"d\" to indicate the variable of integration (i.e.,  d x   instead of   dx  ), since properly speaking, \"d\" is not a variable. Also, the symbol  dx  is not always placed after   f ( x ) , as for instance in ,  In the first expression, the differential is treated as an infinitesimal \"multiplicative\" factor, formally following a \"commutative property\" when \"multiplied\" by the expression 3/( x  2 +1). In the second expression, showing the differentials first highlights and clarifies the variables that are being integrated with respect to, a practice particularly popular with physicists. ,  Integrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but  precision engineering  (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements. ,  To start off, consider the curve   y  =  f ( x )  between   x  = 0  and   x  = 1  with   f ( x ) =  √  x     (see figure). We ask: ,  and call this (yet unknown) area the (definite)  integral  of  f . The notation for this integral will be ,  As a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides   x  = 0  to   x  = 1  and   y  =  f (0) = 0  and   y  =  f (1) = 1 . Its area is exactly 1. As it is, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles shall give a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus   √ 1/5   ,   √ 2/5   , and so on to   √ 1   = 1 . Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely ,  We are taking a sum of finitely many function values of  f , multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will never be exact: replacing the five subintervals by twelve in the same way, but with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203, which is too small. The key idea is the transition from adding  finitely many  differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or   infinitesimal   steps. ,  The notation ,  conceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated  s , of function values,   f ( x ) , multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called  differentials , denoted by  dx . The multiplication sign is usually omitted. ,  Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a  limit  of weighted sums, so that the  dx  suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann\\'s dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the  Lebesgue integral , which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of \"measure\" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation ,  refers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with  μ  measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here  A  denotes the region of integration. ,  There are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals. ,  The Riemann integral is defined in terms of  Riemann sums  of functions with respect to  tagged partitions  of an interval.  [3]   Let  [ a ,  b ]  be a  closed interval  of the real line; then a  tagged partition  of  [ a ,  b ]  is a finite sequence ,  This partitions the interval  [ a ,  b ]  into  n  sub-intervals  [ x   i −1 ,  x   i  ]  indexed by  i , each of which is \"tagged\" with a distinguished point   t   i   ∈ [ x   i −1 ,  x   i  ] . A  Riemann sum  of a function  f  with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as ,  thus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let  Δ  i   =  x   i  − x   i −1   be the width of sub-interval  i ; then the  mesh  of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition,  max  i =1... n   Δ  i   . The  Riemann integral  of a function  f  over the interval  [ a ,  b ]  is equal to  S  if: ,  When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower)  Darboux sum , suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the  Darboux integral . ,  It is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated ( Rudin 1987 ). ,  Such an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus  Henri Lebesgue  introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to  Paul Montel : ,  I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral. ,  As  Folland (1984 , p.\\xa056) puts it, \"To compute the Riemann integral of  f , one partitions the domain  [ a ,  b ]  into subintervals\", while in the Lebesgue integral, \"one is in effect partitioning the range of  f \". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a  measure , μ. In the simplest case, the  Lebesgue measure    μ ( A )  of an interval   A  = [ a ,  b ]  is its width,   b  −  a  , so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals. ,  Using the \"partitioning the range of  f \" philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function   f \\xa0:  R  →  R   should be the sum over  t  of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between   y  =  t   and   y  =  t  +  dt  . This area is just   μ {  x \\xa0:  f ( x ) &gt;  t }\\u2009 dt  . Let   f  ∗ ( t ) =  μ {  x \\xa0:  f ( x ) &gt;  t  }. The Lebesgue integral of  f  is then defined by ( Lieb &amp; Loss 2001 ) ,  where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral (  f  ∗   is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a  well-defined  improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the  measurable functions ) this defines the Lebesgue integral. ,  A general measurable function  f  is Lebesgue-integrable if the area between the graph of  f  and the  x -axis is finite: ,  In that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the  x -axis and the area below the  x -axis: ,  where ,  Although the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including: ,  The collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval  [ a ,  b ]  forms a  vector space  under the operations of  pointwise addition  and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration ,  is a  linear functional  on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking  linear combinations ; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals, ,  Similarly, the set of  real -valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given  measure space   E  with measure  μ  is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral ,  is a linear functional on this vector space, so that ,  More generally, consider the vector space of all  measurable functions  on a measure space  ( E , μ ) , taking values in a  locally compact   complete   topological vector space   V  over a locally compact  topological field    K ,  f \\xa0:  E  →  V  . Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function  f  an element of  V  or the symbol   ∞  , ,  that is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of  V  (i.e. \"finite\"). The most important special cases arise when  K  is   R  ,   C  , or a finite extension of the field   Q   p    of  p-adic numbers , and  V  is a finite-dimensional vector space over  K , and when   K  =  C   and  V  is a complex  Hilbert space . ,  Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of \"simple\" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of  Daniell  for the case of real-valued functions on a set  X , generalized by  Nicolas Bourbaki  to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See ( Hildebrandt 1953 ) for an axiomatic characterisation of the integral. ,  A number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable  functions  defined on a  closed  and  bounded   interval   [ a ,  b ]  and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell). ,  In this section,  f  is a  real-valued  Riemann-integrable  function . The integral ,  over an interval  [ a ,  b ]  is defined if   a  &lt;  b  . This means that the upper and lower sums of the function  f  are evaluated on a partition   a  =  x  0  ≤  x  1  ≤ . . . ≤  x   n   =  b   whose values   x   i    are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place \"left to right\", evaluating  f  within intervals  [ x  \\u2009 i  \\u2009,  x  \\u2009 i \\u2009+1 ]  where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values  a  and  b , the end-points of the  interval , are called the  limits of integration  of  f . Integrals can also be defined if   a  &gt;  b  : ,  This, with   a  =  b  , implies: ,  The first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of  [ a ,  b ] ; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a  point , should be  zero . One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of  f  on an interval  [ a ,  b ]  implies that  f  is integrable on any subinterval  [ c ,  d ] , but in particular integrals have the property that: ,  With the first convention, the resulting relation ,  is then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of  a ,  b , and  c . ,  The  fundamental theorem of calculus  is the statement that  differentiation  and integration are inverse operations: if a  continuous function  is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved. An important consequence, sometimes called the  second fundamental theorem of calculus , allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated. ,  Let  f  be a continuous real-valued function defined on a  closed interval   [ a ,  b ] . Let  F  be the function defined, for all  x  in  [ a ,  b ] , by ,  Then,  F  is continuous on  [ a ,  b ] , differentiable on the open interval  ( a ,  b ) , and ,  for all  x  in  ( a ,  b ) . ,  Let  f  be a real-valued function defined on a  closed interval   [ a ,  b ]  that admits an  antiderivative   F  on  [ a ,  b ] . That is,  f  and  F  are functions such that for all  x  in  [ a ,  b ] , ,  If  f  is integrable on  [ a ,  b ]  then ,  The second fundamental theorem allows many integrals to be calculated explicitly. For example, to calculate the integral ,  of the square root function   f ( x ) =  x  1/2   between 0 and 1, it is sufficient to find an antiderivative, that is, a function   F ( x )  whose derivative equals   f ( x ) : ,  One such function is   F ( x ) =   2  /  3   x  3/2  . Then the value of the integral in question is ,  This is a case of a general rule, that for   f ( x ) =  x   q   , with   q  ≠ −1 , the related function, the so-called antiderivative is   F ( x ) =  x   q  + 1 /( q  + 1).  Tables of this and similar antiderivatives can be used to calculate integrals explicitly, in much the same way that tables of derivatives can be used. ,  A \"proper\" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the  limit  of a  sequence  of proper  Riemann integrals  on progressively larger intervals. ,  If the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity. ,  If the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance  ( a ,  b ] , then again a limit may provide a finite result. ,  That is, the improper integral is the  limit  of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified  real number , or  ∞ , or  −∞ . In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points. ,  Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the  area  of the region between the graph of the function and the  x -axis, the  double integral  of a positive function of two variables represents the  volume  of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane that contains its  domain . For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables,  x  and  y , and the integral of a function  f  over the rectangle  R  given as the  Cartesian product  of two intervals    \\n \\n \\n \\n R \\n = \\n [ \\n a \\n , \\n b \\n ] \\n ×  \\n [ \\n c \\n , \\n d \\n ] \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle R=[a,b]\\\\times [c,d]} \\n \\n     can be written ,  where the differential   dA   indicates that integration is taken with respect to area. This  double integral  can be defined using  Riemann sums , and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of   z  =  f ( x , y )  over the domain  R . Under suitable conditions (e.g., if  f  is continuous), then  Fubini\\'s theorem  guarantees that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral ,  This reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because of this, another notation for the integral over  R  uses a double integral sign: ,  Integration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function  f , with respect to volume, over a subset  D  of ℝ n  is denoted by notation such as ,  or similar. See  volume integral . ,  The concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with  vector fields . ,  A  line integral  (sometimes called a  path integral ) is an integral where the  function  to be integrated is evaluated along a  curve . Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a  contour integral . ,  The function to be integrated may be a  scalar field  or a  vector field . The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly  arc length  or, for a vector field, the  scalar product  of the vector field with a  differential  vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on  intervals . Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that  work  is equal to  force ,   F  , multiplied by displacement,   s  , may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as: ,  For an object moving along a path   C   in a  vector field    F   such as an  electric field  or  gravitational field , the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from   s   to   s  +  d  s  . This gives the line integral ,  A  surface integral  is a definite integral taken over a  surface  (which may be a curved set in  space ); it can be thought of as the  double integral  analog of the  line integral . The function to be integrated may be a  scalar field  or a  vector field . The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums. ,  For an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field   v   on a surface   S  ; that is, for each point   x   in   S  ,   v ( x )  is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through   S  , such that   v ( x )  determines the velocity of the fluid at  x . The  flux  is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through   S   in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the  dot product  of   v   with the unit  surface normal  to   S   at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface: ,  The fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the  classical theory  of  electromagnetism . ,  In  complex analysis , the integrand is a  complex-valued function  of a complex variable  z  instead of a real function of a real variable  x . When a complex function is integrated along a curve    \\n \\n \\n \\n γ  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\gamma } \\n \\n     in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows ,  This is known as a  contour integral . ,  A  differential form  is a mathematical concept in the fields of  multivariable calculus ,  differential topology , and  tensors . Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as: ,  where  E ,  F ,  G  are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials  dx ,  dy ,  dz  measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes. ,  A differential two-form is a sum of the form ,  Here the basic two-forms    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n x \\n ∧  \\n d \\n y \\n , \\n d \\n z \\n ∧  \\n d \\n x \\n , \\n d \\n y \\n ∧  \\n d \\n z \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle dx\\\\wedge dy,dz\\\\wedge dx,dy\\\\wedge dz} \\n \\n     measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes. The symbol    \\n \\n \\n \\n ∧  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\wedge } \\n \\n     denotes the  wedge product , which is similar to the  cross product  in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of    \\n \\n \\n \\n E \\n \\n i \\n \\n + \\n F \\n \\n j \\n \\n + \\n G \\n \\n k \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle E\\\\mathbf {i} +F\\\\mathbf {j} +G\\\\mathbf {k} } \\n \\n    . ,  Unlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The  exterior derivative  plays the role of the  gradient  and  curl  of vector calculus, and  Stokes\\' theorem  simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the  divergence theorem ,  Green\\'s theorem , and the  Kelvin-Stokes theorem . ,  The discrete equivalent of integration is  summation . Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of  Lebesgue integrals  or  time scale calculus . ,  The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the  fundamental theorem of calculus . Let   f ( x )  be the function of  x  to be integrated over a given interval  [ a ,  b ] . Then, find an antiderivative of  f ; that is, a function  F  such that   F ′ =  f   on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no  singularities  on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, ,  The integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals. ,  The most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of  f . It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include: ,  Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many  nonelementary integrals  can be expanded in a  Taylor series  and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using  Meijer G-functions  can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance,  Parseval\\'s identity  can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see  Gaussian integral . ,  Computations of volumes of  solids of revolution  can usually be done with  disk integration  or  shell integration . ,  Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the  list of integrals . ,  Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive  tables of integrals  have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to  computer algebra systems  that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like  Macsyma . ,  A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions  exp( x  2 ),  x   x    and  (sin  x )/ x   cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only  rational  and  exponential  functions,  logarithm ,  trigonometric functions  and  inverse trigonometric functions , and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in  elementary functions , which are the functions which may be built from rational functions,  roots of a polynomial , logarithm, and exponential functions. The  Risch algorithm  provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the \\'building blocks\\' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The  Risch algorithm , implemented in  Mathematica  and other  computer algebra systems , does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions,  radicals , logarithm, and exponential functions. ,  Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the  special functions  (like the  Legendre functions , the  hypergeometric function , the  gamma function , the  incomplete gamma function  and so on\\xa0— see  Symbolic integration  for more details). Extending the Risch\\'s algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject. ,  More recently a new approach has emerged, using   D -finite functions , which are the solutions of  linear differential equations  with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are  D -finite, and the integral of a  D -finite function is also a  D -finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a  D -finite function as the solution of a differential equation. ,  This theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a  D -function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.  [4]   ,  Some integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives. Others are not so accommodating. Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called  numerical integration  or  numerical quadrature , arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures ( Dahlquist &amp; Björck 2008 ;  Kahaner, Moler &amp; Nash 1989 ;  Stoer &amp; Bulirsch 2002 ). ,  Consider, for example, the integral ,  which has the exact answer  94/25 = 3.76 . (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task\\xa0— not explored here\\xa0— is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values. ,  Using the left end of each piece, the  rectangle method  sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width,  h , here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2 18  pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle. ,  A better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The  trapezoid rule  is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2 10  pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further.  Simpson\\'s rule  approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson\\'s rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called  Newton–Cotes formulas . The degree   n   Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree   n   polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson\\'s rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to  Runge\\'s phenomenon . One solution to this problem is  Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature , in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of  Chebyshev polynomials . This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function. ,   Romberg\\'s method  builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by   T ( h  0 ),  T ( h  1 ) , and so on, where   h   k +1   is half of   h   k   . For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to  interpolate  a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to   T (0) . With this method a numerically  exact  answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The  Lagrange polynomial  interpolating  { h   k  , T ( h   k  )}  k  = 0...2  =  {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148  h  2  , producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at   h  = 0 . ,   Gaussian quadrature  often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two  x  positions,  ±2 ⁄  √ 3   , then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton–Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of  orthogonal polynomials . An  n -point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to  2 n  − 1 . The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.) ,  In practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular  Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formulae . More broadly,  adaptive quadrature  partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most. ,  The computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as  Monte Carlo integration . ,  A calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage. For example, the integral    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n −  \\n 1 \\n \\n / \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n e \\n \\n −  \\n x \\n \\n \\n  \\n d \\n x \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\int _{0}^{1}x^{-1/2}e^{-x}\\\\,dx} \\n \\n     is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at   x  = 0 . However, the substitution   u  = √ x   transforms the integral into    \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n e \\n \\n −  \\n \\n u \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n d \\n u \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle 2\\\\int _{0}^{1}e^{-u^{2}}\\\\,du} \\n \\n    , which has no singularities at all. ,  The area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called  planimeter . The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid  displaced  as the object is submerged. ,  Area can be found via  geometrical   compass-and-straightedge constructions  of an equivalent  square , e.g.,  squaring the circle . ]',\n",
       " '[ In the branch of  mathematics  known as  real analysis , the  Riemann integral , created by  Bernhard Riemann , was the first rigorous definition of the  integral  of a  function  on an  interval . It was presented to the faculty at the  University of Göttingen  in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868.  [1]   For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the  fundamental theorem of calculus  or approximated by  numerical integration . ,  The Riemann integral is unsuitable for many theoretical purposes. Some of the technical deficiencies in Riemann integration can be remedied with the  Riemann–Stieltjes integral , and most disappear with the  Lebesgue integral . ,   ,   ,  Let  f  be a nonnegative  real -valued function on the interval  [ a ,  b ] , and let ,  be the region of the plane under the graph of the function  f  and above the interval  [ a ,  b ]  (see the figure on the top right). We are interested in measuring the area of  S . Once we have measured it, we will denote the area by: ,  The basic idea of the Riemann integral is to use very simple approximations for the area of  S . By taking better and better approximations, we can say that \"in the limit\" we get exactly the area of  S  under the curve. ,  Note that where  f  can be both positive and negative, the definition of  S  is modified so that the integral corresponds to the  signed area  under the graph of  f : that is, the area above the  x -axis minus the area below the  x -axis. ,  A  partition of an interval   [ a ,  b ]  is a finite sequence of numbers of the form ,  Each  [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ]  is called a  subinterval  of the partition. The  mesh  or  norm  of a partition is defined to be the length of the longest subinterval, that is, ,  A  tagged partition    P ( x ,  t )  of an interval  [ a ,  b ]  is a partition together with a finite sequence of numbers   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   subject to the conditions that for each  i ,   t i   ∈ [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ] . In other words, it is a partition together with a distinguished point of every subinterval. The mesh of a tagged partition is the same as that of an ordinary partition. ,  Suppose that two partitions   P ( x ,  t )  and   Q ( y ,  s )  are both partitions of the interval  [ a ,  b ] . We say that   Q ( y ,  s )  is a  refinement  of   P ( x ,  t )  if for each integer  i , with   i  ∈ [0,  n ] , there exists an integer   r ( i )  such that   x i   =  y   r ( i )   and such that   t i   =  s j    for some  j  with   j  ∈ [ r ( i ),  r ( i  + 1)) . Said more simply, a refinement of a tagged partition breaks up some of the subintervals and adds tags to the partition where necessary, thus it \"refines\" the accuracy of the partition. ,  We can define a  partial order  on the set of all tagged partitions by saying that one tagged partition is greater or equal to another if the former is a refinement of the latter. ,  Let  f  be a real-valued function defined on the interval  [ a ,  b ] . The   Riemann sum   of  f  with respect to the tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    together with   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   is  [2]   ,  Each term in the sum is the product of the value of the function at a given point and the length of an interval. Consequently, each term represents the (signed) area of a rectangle with height   f ( t i  )  and width   x   i  + 1  −  x i   . The Riemann sum is the (signed) area of all the rectangles. ,  A closely related concept are the  lower and upper Darboux sums . These are similar to Riemann sums, but the tags are replaced by the  infimum and supremum  (respectively) of  f  on each subinterval: ,  If  f  is continuous, then the lower and upper Darboux sums for an untagged partition are equal to the Riemann sum for that partition, where the tags are chosen to be the minimum or maximum (respectively) of  f  on each subinterval. (When  f  is discontinuous on a subinterval, there may not be a tag that achieves the infimum or supremum on that subinterval.) The  Darboux integral , which is similar to the Riemann integral but based on Darboux sums, is equivalent to the Riemann integral. ,  Loosely speaking, the Riemann integral is the limit of the Riemann sums of a function as the partitions get finer. If the limit exists then the function is said to be  integrable  (or more specifically  Riemann-integrable ). The Riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the Riemann integral by making the partition fine enough.  [3]   ,  One important requirement is that the mesh of the partitions must become smaller and smaller, so that in the limit, it is zero. If this were not so, then we would not be getting a good approximation to the function on certain subintervals. In fact, this is enough to define an integral. To be specific, we say that the Riemann integral of  f  equals  s  if the following condition holds: ,  For all   ε  &gt; 0 , there exists  δ  such that for any tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   whose mesh is less than  δ , we have ,  Unfortunately, this definition is very difficult to use. It would help to develop an equivalent definition of the Riemann integral which is easier to work with. We develop this definition now, with a proof of equivalence following. Our new definition says that the Riemann integral of  f  equals  s  if the following condition holds: ,  For all   ε  &gt; 0 , there exists a tagged partition   y  0 , ...,  y m    and   r  0 , ...,  r   m  − 1   such that for any tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   which is a refinement of   y  0 , ...,  y m    and   r  0 , ...,  r   m  − 1  , we have ,  Both of these mean that eventually, the Riemann sum of  f  with respect to any partition gets trapped close to  s . Since this is true no matter how close we demand the sums be trapped, we say that the Riemann sums converge to  s . These definitions are actually a special case of a more general concept, a  net . ,  As we stated earlier, these two definitions are equivalent. In other words,  s  works in the first definition if and only if  s  works in the second definition. To show that the first definition implies the second, start with an  ε , and choose a  δ  that satisfies the condition. Choose any tagged partition whose mesh is less than  δ . Its Riemann sum is within  ε  of  s , and any refinement of this partition will also have mesh less than  δ , so the Riemann sum of the refinement will also be within  ε  of  s . ,  To show that the second definition implies the first, it is easiest to use the  Darboux integral . First, one shows that the second definition is equivalent to the definition of the Darboux integral; for this see the article on Darboux integration. Now we will show that a Darboux integrable function satisfies the first definition. Fix  ε , and choose a partition   y  0 , ...,  y m    such that the lower and upper Darboux sums with respect to this partition are within   ε /2  of the value  s  of the Darboux integral. Let ,  If   r  = 0 , then  f  is the zero function, which is clearly both Darboux and Riemann integrable with integral zero. Therefore, we will assume that   r  &gt; 0 . If   m  &gt; 1 , then we choose  δ  such that ,  If   m  = 1 , then we choose  δ  to be less than one. Choose a tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   with mesh smaller than  δ . We must show that the Riemann sum is within  ε  of  s . ,  To see this, choose an interval  [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ] . If this interval is contained within some  [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] , then ,  where  m j   and  M j   are respectively, the infimum and the supremum of  f  on  [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] . If all intervals had this property, then this would conclude the proof, because each term in the Riemann sum would be bounded by a corresponding term in the Darboux sums, and we chose the Darboux sums to be near  s . This is the case when   m  = 1 , so the proof is finished in that case. ,  Therefore, we may assume that   m  &gt; 1 . In this case, it is possible that one of the  [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ]  is not contained in any  [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] . Instead, it may stretch across two of the intervals determined by   y  0 , ...,  y m   . (It cannot meet three intervals because  δ  is assumed to be smaller than the length of any one interval.) In symbols, it may happen that ,  (We may assume that all the inequalities are strict because otherwise we are in the previous case by our assumption on the length of  δ .) This can happen at most   m  − 1  times. ,  To handle this case, we will estimate the difference between the Riemann sum and the Darboux sum by subdividing the partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    at   y   j  + 1  . The term   f ( t i  )( x   i  + 1  −  x i  )  in the Riemann sum splits into two terms: ,  Suppose, without loss of generality, that   t i   ∈ [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] . Then ,  so this term is bounded by the corresponding term in the Darboux sum for  y j  . To bound the other term, notice that ,  It follows that, for some (indeed any)   t  * \\n i   ∈ [ y   j  + 1 ,  x   i  + 1 ] , ,  Since this happens at most   m  − 1  times, the distance between the Riemann sum and a Darboux sum is at most   ε /2 . Therefore, the distance between the Riemann sum and  s  is at most\\xa0 ε . ,  Let   f \\xa0: [0, 1] →  R   be the function which takes the value 1 at every point. Any Riemann sum of  f  on  [0, 1]  will have the value 1, therefore the Riemann integral of  f  on  [0, 1]  is 1. ,  Let   I   Q  \\xa0: [0, 1] →  R   be the  indicator function  of the rational numbers in  [0, 1] ; that is,   I   Q    takes the value 1 on rational numbers and 0 on irrational numbers. This function does not have a Riemann integral. To prove this, we will show how to construct tagged partitions whose Riemann sums get arbitrarily close to both zero and one. ,  To start, let   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   be a tagged partition (each  t i   is between  x i   and   x   i  + 1  ). Choose   ε  &gt; 0 . The  t i   have already been chosen, and we can\\'t change the value of  f  at those points. But if we cut the partition into tiny pieces around each  t i  , we can minimize the effect of the  t i  . Then, by carefully choosing the new tags, we can make the value of the Riemann sum turn out to be within  ε  of either zero or one. ,  Our first step is to cut up the partition. There are  n  of the  t i  , and we want their total effect to be less than  ε . If we confine each of them to an interval of length less than   ε / n  , then the contribution of each  t i   to the Riemann sum will be at least  0 ·  ε / n   and at most  1 ·  ε / n  . This makes the total sum at least zero and at most  ε . So let  δ  be a positive number less than   ε / n  . If it happens that two of the  t i   are within  δ  of each other, choose  δ  smaller. If it happens that some  t i   is within  δ  of some  x j  , and  t i   is not equal to  x j  , choose  δ  smaller. Since there are only finitely many  t i   and  x j  , we can always choose  δ  sufficiently small. ,  Now we add two cuts to the partition for each  t i  . One of the cuts will be at   t i   −  δ /2 , and the other will be at   t i   +  δ /2 . If one of these leaves the interval [0, 1], then we leave it out.  t i   will be the tag corresponding to the subinterval ,  If  t i   is directly on top of one of the  x j  , then we let  t i   be the tag for both intervals: ,  We still have to choose tags for the other subintervals. We will choose them in two different ways. The first way is to always choose a  rational point , so that the Riemann sum is as large as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at least  1 −  ε  . The second way is to always choose an irrational point, so that the Riemann sum is as small as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at most  ε . ,  Since we started from an arbitrary partition and ended up as close as we wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number  s , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is  Lebesgue integrable . In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero  almost everywhere . But this is a fact that is beyond the reach of the Riemann integral. ,  There are even worse examples.   I   Q    is equivalent (that is, equal almost everywhere) to a Riemann integrable function, but there are non-Riemann integrable bounded functions which are not equivalent to any Riemann integrable function. For example, let  C  be the  Smith–Volterra–Cantor set , and let   I   C    be its indicator function. Because  C  is not  Jordan measurable ,   I   C    is not Riemann integrable. Moreover, no function  g  equivalent to   I   C    is Riemann integrable:  g , like   I   C   , must be zero on a dense set, so as in the previous example, any Riemann sum of  g  has a refinement which is within  ε  of 0 for any positive number\\xa0 ε . But if the Riemann integral of  g  exists, then it must equal the Lebesgue integral of   I   C   , which is  1/2 . Therefore,  g  is not Riemann integrable. ,  It is popular to define the Riemann integral as the  Darboux integral . This is because the Darboux integral is technically simpler and because a function is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is Darboux-integrable. ,  Some calculus books do not use general tagged partitions, but limit themselves to specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions may appear to be integrable. ,  One popular restriction is the use of \"left-hand\" and \"right-hand\" Riemann sums. In a left-hand Riemann sum,   t i   =  x i    for all  i , and in a right-hand Riemann sum,   t i   =  x   i  + 1   for all  i . Alone this restriction does not impose a problem: we can refine any partition in a way that makes it a left-hand or right-hand sum by subdividing it at each  t i  . In more formal language, the set of all left-hand Riemann sums and the set of all right-hand Riemann sums is  cofinal  in the set of all tagged partitions. ,  Another popular restriction is the use of regular subdivisions of an interval. For example, the  n th regular subdivision of  [0, 1]  consists of the intervals ,  Again, alone this restriction does not impose a problem, but the reasoning required to see this fact is more difficult than in the case of left-hand and right-hand Riemann sums. ,  However, combining these restrictions, so that one uses only left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums on regularly divided intervals, is dangerous. If a function is known in advance to be Riemann integrable, then this technique will give the correct value of the integral. But under these conditions the  indicator function    I   Q    will appear to be integrable on  [0, 1]  with integral equal to one: Every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number, so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers, and hence it will appear to always equal one. The problem with this definition becomes apparent when we try to split the integral into two pieces. The following equation ought to hold: ,  If we use regular subdivisions and left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums, then the two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1. ,  As defined above, the Riemann integral avoids this problem by refusing to integrate   I   Q   . The Lebesgue integral is defined in such a way that all these integrals are 0. ,  The Riemann integral is a linear transformation; that is, if  f  and  g  are Riemann-integrable on  [ a ,  b ]  and  α  and  β  are constants, then ,  Because the Riemann integral of a function is a number, this makes the Riemann integral a  linear functional  on the  vector space  of Riemann-integrable functions. ,  A  bounded function  on a  compact interval   [ a ,  b ]  is Riemann integrable if and only if it is  continuous   almost everywhere  (the set of its points of discontinuity has  measure zero , in the sense of  Lebesgue measure ). This is known as the     Lebesgue\\'s integrability condition   or  Lebesgue\\'s criterion for Riemann integrability  or the  Riemann–Lebesgue theorem .  [4]   The criterion has  nothing to do  with the  Lebesgue integral . It is due to  Lebesgue  and uses his  measure zero , but makes use of neither Lebesgue\\'s general measure or integral. ,  The integrability condition can be proven in various ways,  [4]    [5]    [6]    [7]   one of which is sketched below. ,  One direction can be proven using the  oscillation  definition of continuity:  [8]   For every positive  ε , Let   X   ε    be the set of points in  [ a ,  b ]  with oscillation of at least  ε . Since every point where  f  is discontinuous has a positive oscillation and vice versa, the set of points in  [ a ,  b ] , where  f  is discontinuous is equal to the union over  { X  1/ n  }  for all natural numbers  n . ,  If this set does not have a zero  Lebesgue measure , then by  countable additivity  of the measure there is at least one such  n  so that   X  1/ n    does not have a zero measure. Thus there is some positive number  c  such that every  countable  collection of open intervals  covering    X  1/ n    has a total length of at least  c . In particular this is also true for every such finite collection of intervals. Note that this remains true also for   X  1/ n    less a finite number of points (as a finite number of points can always be covered by a finite collection of intervals with arbitrarily small total length). ,  For every  partition of  [ a ,  b ]  , consider the set of intervals whose interiors include points from   X  1/ n   . These interiors consist of a finite open cover of   X  1/ n   , possibly up to a finite number of points (which may fall on interval edges). Thus these intervals have a total length of at least  c . Since in these points  f  has oscillation of at least  1/ n  , the  infimum and supremum  of  f  in each of these intervals differ by at least  1/ n  . Thus the upper and lower sums of  f  differ by at least   c / n  . Since this is true for every partition,  f  is not Riemann integrable. ,  We now prove the converse direction using the sets   X   ε    defined above.  [9]   Note that for every  ε ,   X   ε    is  compact , as it is bounded (by  a  and  b ) and closed: ,  Now, suppose that  f  is continuous  almost everywhere . Then for every  ε ,   X   ε    has zero  Lebesgue measure . Therefore, there is a countable collections of open intervals in  [ a ,  b ]  which is an  open cover  of   X   ε   , such that the sum over all their lengths is arbitrarily small.  Since   X   ε    is compact , there is a finite  subcover  – a finite collections of open intervals in  [ a ,  b ]  with arbitrarily small total length that together contain all points in   X   ε   . We denote these intervals  { I ( ε )  i  } , for  1 ≤  i  ≤  k  , for some natural  k . ,  The  complement  of the union of these intervals is itself a union of a finite number of intervals, which we denote  { J ( ε )  i  }  (for  1 ≤  i  ≤  k  − 1  and possibly for   i  =  k ,  k  + 1  as well). ,  We now show that for every   ε  &gt; 0 , there are  upper and lower sums  whose difference is less than  ε , from which Riemann integrability follows. To this end, we construct a  partition of  [ a ,  b ]   as follows: ,  Denote   ε  1  =  ε  / 2( b  −  a )  and   ε  2  =  ε  / 2( M  −  m ) , where  m  and  M  are the  infimum and supremum  of  f  on  [ a ,  b ] . Since we may choose intervals  { I ( ε  1 )  i  }  with arbitrarily small total length, we choose them to have total length smaller than   ε  2  . ,  Each of the intervals  { J ( ε  1 )  i  }  has an empty intersection with   X   ε  1   , so each point in it has a neighborhood with oscillation smaller than   ε  1  . These neighborhoods consist of an  open cover  of the interval, and since the interval is compact there is a finite subcover of them. This subcover is a finite collection of open intervals, which are subintervals of   J ( ε  1 )  i    (except for those that include an edge point, for which we only take their intersection with   J ( ε  1 )  i  ) . We take the edge points of the subintervals for all   J ( ε  1 )  i   −  s  , including the edge points of the intervals themselves, as our partition. ,  Thus the partition divides  [ a ,  b ]  to two kinds of intervals: ,  In total, the difference between the upper and lower sums of the partition is smaller than  ε , as required. ,  In particular, any set that is at most  countable  has  Lebesgue measure  zero, and thus a bounded function (on a compact interval) with only finitely or countably many discontinuities is Riemann integrable. ,  An  indicator function  of a bounded set is Riemann-integrable if and only if the set is  Jordan measurable .  [10]   The Riemann integral can be interpreted  measure-theoretically  as the integral with respect to the Jordan measure. ,  If a real-valued function is  monotone  on the interval  [ a ,  b ]  it is Riemann-integrable, since its set of discontinuities is at most countable, and therefore of Lebesgue measure zero. ,  If a real-valued function on  [ a ,  b ]  is Riemann-integrable, it is  Lebesgue-integrable . That is, Riemann-integrability is a  stronger  (meaning more difficult to satisfy) condition than Lebesgue-integrability. ,  If   f   n    is a  uniformly convergent  sequence on  [ a ,  b ]  with limit  f , then Riemann integrability of all   f   n    implies Riemann integrability of  f , and ,  However, the  Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem  (on a monotone pointwise limit) does not hold. In Riemann integration, taking limits under the integral sign is far more difficult to logically justify than in Lebesgue integration.  [11]   ,  It is easy to extend the Riemann integral to functions with values in the Euclidean vector space   R   n    for any  n . The integral is defined component-wise; in other words, if   f  = ( f  1 , ...,  f   n  )  then ,  In particular, since the complex numbers are a real  vector space , this allows the integration of complex valued functions. ,  The Riemann integral is only defined on bounded intervals, and it does not extend well to unbounded intervals. The simplest possible extension is to define such an integral as a limit, in other words, as an  improper integral : ,  This definition carries with it some subtleties, such as the fact that it is not always equivalent to compute the  Cauchy principal value  ,  For example, consider the function   f ( x )  which is 0 at   x  = 0 , 1 for   x  &gt; 0 , and −1 for   x  &lt; 0 . By symmetry, ,  always, regardless of  a . But there are many ways for the interval of integration to expand to fill the real line, and other ways can produce different results; in other words, the multivariate limit does not always exist. We can compute ,  In general, this improper Riemann integral is undefined. Even standardizing a way for the interval to approach the real line does not work because it leads to disturbingly counterintuitive results. If we agree (for instance) that the improper integral should always be ,  then the integral of the translation   f ( x  − 1)  is −2, so this definition is not invariant under shifts, a highly undesirable property. In fact, not only does this function not have an improper Riemann integral, its Lebesgue integral is also undefined (it equals  ∞ − ∞ ). ,  Unfortunately, the improper Riemann integral is not powerful enough. The most severe problem is that there are no widely applicable theorems for commuting improper Riemann integrals with limits of functions. In applications such as  Fourier series  it is important to be able to approximate the integral of a function using integrals of approximations to the function. For proper Riemann integrals, a standard theorem states that if   f   n    is a sequence of functions that  converge uniformly  to  f  on a compact set  [ a ,  b ] , then ,  On non-compact intervals such as the real line, this is false. For example, take   f   n  ( x )  to be   n  −1   on  [0,  n ]  and zero elsewhere. For all  n  we have: ,  The sequence  { f   n  }  converges uniformly to the zero function, and clearly the integral of the zero function is zero. Consequently, ,  This demonstrates that for integrals on unbounded intervals, uniform convergence of a function is not strong enough to allow passing a limit through an integral sign. This makes the Riemann integral unworkable in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands. ,  A better route is to abandon the Riemann integral for the  Lebesgue integral . The definition of the Lebesgue integral is not obviously a generalization of the Riemann integral, but it is not hard to prove that every Riemann-integrable function is Lebesgue-integrable and that the values of the two integrals agree whenever they are both defined. Moreover, a function  f  defined on a bounded interval is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is bounded and the set of points where  f  is discontinuous has Lebesgue measure zero. ,  An integral which is in fact a direct generalization of the Riemann integral is the  Henstock–Kurzweil integral . ,  Another way of generalizing the Riemann integral is to replace the factors   x   k  + 1  −  x   k    in the definition of a Riemann sum by something else; roughly speaking, this gives the interval of integration a different notion of length. This is the approach taken by the  Riemann–Stieltjes integral . ,  In  multivariable calculus , the Riemann integrals for functions from   R   n   →  R   are  multiple integrals . ]',\n",
       " '[ In  mathematics , the  Riemann–Stieltjes integral  is a generalization of the  Riemann integral , named after  Bernhard Riemann  and  Thomas Joannes Stieltjes . The definition of this integral was first published in 1894 by Stieltjes.  [1]   It serves as an instructive and useful precursor of the  Lebesgue integral , and an invaluable tool in unifying equivalent forms of statistical theorems that apply to discrete and continuous probability. ,   ,   ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes  integral  of a  real -valued function  f  of a real variable with respect to a real function  g  is denoted by ,  and defined to be the limit, as the  norm  (or  mesh ) of the  partition  ,  of the interval [ a ,\\xa0 b ] approaches zero, of the approximating sum ,  where  c   i   is in the  i -th subinterval [ x   i  ,\\xa0 x   i +1 ]. The two functions  f  and  g  are respectively called the integrand and the integrator. ,  The \"limit\" is here understood to be a number  A  (the value of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral) such that for every  ε \\xa0&gt;\\xa00, there exists  δ \\xa0&gt;\\xa00 such that for every partition  P  with mesh( P )\\xa0&lt;\\xa0 δ , and for every choice of points  c   i   in [ x   i  ,\\xa0 x   i +1 ], ,  A slight generalization, introduced by  Pollard (1920)  and now standard in analysis, is to consider in the above definition partitions  P  that  refine  another partition  P   ε  , meaning that  P  arises from  P   ε   by the addition of points, rather than from partitions with a finer mesh. Specifically, the  generalized Riemann–Stieltjes integral  of  f  with respect to  g  is a number  A  such that for every  ε \\xa0&gt;\\xa00 there exists a partition  P   ε   such that for every partition  P  that refines  P   ε  , ,  for every choice of points  c   i   in [ x   i  ,\\xa0 x   i +1 ]. ,  This generalization exhibits the Riemann–Stieltjes integral as the  Moore–Smith limit  on the  directed set  of partitions of [ a ,\\xa0 b ] ( McShane 1952 ).  Hildebrandt (1938)  calls it the  Pollard–Moore–Stieltjes integral . ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral can be efficiently handled using an appropriate generalization of  Darboux sums . For a partition  P  and a nondecreasing function  g  on [ a ,\\xa0 b ] define the upper Darboux sum of  f  with respect to  g  by ,  and the lower sum by ,  Then the generalized Riemann–Stieltjes of  f  with respect to  g  exists if and only if, for every ε\\xa0&gt;\\xa00, there exists a partition  P  such that ,  Furthermore,  f  is Riemann–Stieltjes integrable with respect to  g  (in the classical sense) if ,  See  Graves (1946 , Chap. XII, §3). ,  If  g  should happen to be everywhere  differentiable , then the Riemann–Stieltjes integral may still be different from the  Riemann integral  of    \\n \\n \\n \\n f \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n \\n g \\n ′ \\n \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle f(x)g\\'(x)} \\n \\n     given by ,  for example, if the derivative    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n ′ \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle g\\'} \\n \\n     is unbounded. But if the derivative    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n ′ \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle g\\'} \\n \\n     is continuous, both integrals coincide. More generally, the Riemann integral equals the Riemann-Stieltjes integrals if    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle g} \\n \\n     is the (Lebesgue) integral of its derivative; in this case    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle g} \\n \\n     is said to be  absolutely continuous . ,  However,    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle g} \\n \\n     may have jump discontinuities, or may have derivative zero  almost  everywhere while still being continuous and increasing (for example,    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle g} \\n \\n     could be the  Cantor function  or  Devil\\'s staircase ), in either of which cases the Riemann–Stieltjes integral is not captured by any expression involving derivatives of  g . ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral admits  integration by parts  in the form ,  and the existence of either integral implies the existence of the other ( Hille &amp; Phillips 1974 , §3.3). ,  The best simple existence theorem states that if  f  is continuous and  g  is of  bounded variation  on [ a ,  b ], then the integral exists.  [2]   A function  g  is of bounded variation if and only if it is the difference between two monotone functions. If  g  is not of bounded variation, then there will be continuous functions which cannot be integrated with respect to  g . In general, the integral is not well-defined if  f  and  g  share any points of  discontinuity , but this sufficient condition is not necessary. ,  On the other hand, a classical result of  Young (1936)  states that the integral is well-defined if  f  is  α - Hölder continuous  and  g  is  β -Hölder continuous with  α  +  β  &gt; 1. ,  If  g  is the  cumulative probability distribution function  of a  random variable   X  that has a  probability density function  with respect to  Lebesgue measure , and  f  is any function for which the  expected value  E(| f ( X )|) is finite [   clarification needed   ] , then the probability density function of  X  is the derivative of  g  and we have ,  But this formula does not work if  X  does not have a probability density function with respect to Lebesgue measure. In particular, it does not work if the distribution of  X  is discrete (i.e., all of the probability is accounted for by point-masses), and even if the cumulative distribution function  g  is continuous, it does not work if  g  fails to be  absolutely continuous  (again, the  Cantor function  may serve as an example of this failure). But the identity ,  holds if  g  is  any  cumulative probability distribution function on the real line, no matter how ill-behaved. In particular, no matter how ill-behaved the cumulative distribution function  g  of a random variable  X , if the  moment  E( X   n  ) exists, then it is equal to ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral appears in the original formulation of F. Riesz\\'s theorem which represents the  dual space  of the  Banach space   C [ a , b ] of continuous functions in an interval [ a , b ] as Riemann–Stieltjes integrals against functions of  bounded variation . Later, that theorem was reformulated in terms of measures. ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral also appears in the formulation of the  spectral theorem  for (non-compact) self-adjoint (or more generally, normal) operators in a Hilbert space. In this theorem, the integral is considered with respect to a spectral family of projections. See  Riesz &amp; Sz. Nagy (1955)  for details. ,  An important generalization is the  Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral  which generalizes the Riemann–Stieltjes integral in a way analogous to how the  Lebesgue integral  generalizes the Riemann integral. If  improper  Riemann–Stieltjes integrals are allowed, the Lebesgue integral is not strictly more general than the Riemann–Stieltjes integral. ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral also generalizes to the case when either the integrand  ƒ  or the integrator  g  take values in a  Banach space . If   g \\xa0: [ a , b ] →  X   takes values in the Banach space  X , then it is natural to assume that it is of  strongly bounded variation , meaning that ,  the supremum being taken over all finite partitions ,  of the interval [ a , b ]. This generalization plays a role in the study of  semigroups , via the  Laplace–Stieltjes transform . ]',\n",
       " '[ The  derivative  of a  function of a real variable  measures the sensitivity to change of the function (output) value with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of  calculus . For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to  time  is the object\\'s  velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. ,  The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the  slope  of the  tangent line  to the  graph of the function  at that point. The tangent line is the best  linear approximation  of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. ,  Derivatives may be generalized to  functions of several real variables . In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a  linear transformation  whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The  Jacobian matrix  is the  matrix  that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the  partial derivatives  with respect to the independent variables. For a  real-valued function  of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the  gradient vector . ,  The process of finding a derivative is called  differentiation . The reverse process is called   antidifferentiation  . The  fundamental theorem of calculus  states that antidifferentiation is the same as  integration . Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.  [Note 1]   ,   ,   ,   Differentiation  is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a  function    y  =  f ( x )  of a variable   x   is a measure of the rate at which the value   y   of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable   x  . It is called the  derivative  of   f   with respect to   x  . If   x   and   y   are  real numbers , and if the  graph  of   f   is plotted against   x  , the derivative is the  slope  of this graph at each point. ,  The simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a  constant function , is when   y   is a  linear function  of   x  , meaning that the graph of   y   is a line. In this case,   y  =  f ( x ) =  m   x  +  b  , for real numbers   m   and   b  , and the slope   m   is given by ,  where the symbol  Δ  ( Delta ) is an abbreviation for \"change in.\" This formula is true because ,  Thus, since ,  it follows that ,  This gives an exact value for the slope of a line. If the function   f   is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), however, then the change in   y   divided by the change in   x   varies: differentiation is a method to find an exact value for this rate of change at any given value of   x  . ,  The idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the  limit value  of the  ratio of the differences   Δ y  / Δ x   as  Δ x   becomes infinitely small. ,  Two distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from  Leibniz  and the other from  Joseph Louis Lagrange . ,  In  Leibniz\\'s notation , an  infinitesimal  change in   x   is denoted by   dx  , and the derivative of   y   with respect to   x   is written ,  suggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities. (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of  y  with respect to  x \", \"d y by d x\", or \"d y over d x\". The oral form \"d y d x\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.) ,  In  Lagrange\\'s notation , the derivative with respect to   x   of a function   f ( x )  is denoted   f \\'  ( x )  (read as \"f prime of x\") or   f x   \\' ( x )  (read as \"f prime x of x\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the derivation. Lagrange\\'s notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to  Newton . ,  The most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a  limit  of difference quotients of real numbers.  [1]   This is the approach described below. ,  Let   f   be a real valued function defined in an  open neighborhood  of a real number   a  . In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function   f   at   a   was the unique line through the point  ( a ,  f ( a ))  that did  not  meet the graph of   f    transversally , meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph. The derivative of   y   with respect to   x   at   a   is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of   f   at  ( a ,  f ( a )) . The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through  ( a ,  f ( a ))  and a nearby point on the graph, for example  ( a  +  h ,  f ( a  +  h )) . These lines are called  secant lines . A value of   h   close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in  absolute value ) of   h   will, in general, give better  approximations . The slope   m   of the secant line is the difference between the   y   values of these points divided by the difference between the   x   values, that is, ,  This expression is  Newton \\'s  difference quotient . Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a  limit . Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line. Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as   h   approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to  ( a ,  f ( a )) . This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function   f   at   a  : ,  When the limit exists,   f   is said to be   differentiable   at   a  . Here   f ′ ( a )  is one of several common notations for the derivative ( see below ). ,  Equivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that ,  which has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to   f   at   a   gives the  best  linear  approximation  ,  to   f   near   a   (i.e., for small   h  ). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ( see below ). ,   Substituting  0 for   h   in the difference quotient causes  division by zero , so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method. Instead, define   Q ( h )  to be the difference quotient as a function of   h  : ,    Q ( h )  is the slope of the secant line between  ( a ,  f ( a ))  and  ( a  +  h ,  f ( a  +  h )) . If   f   is a  continuous function , meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then   Q   is a continuous function away from   h  = 0 . If the limit  lim  h →0  Q ( h )  exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for   Q (0)  that makes   Q   a continuous function, then the function   f   is differentiable at   a  , and its derivative at   a   equals   Q (0) . ,  In practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient   Q ( h )  to   h  = 0  is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel   h   in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of   Q   for small   h   clear even though   Q   is still not defined at   h  = 0 . This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process. ,  Relative to a  hyperreal  extension   R  ⊂  R  *   of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function   y  =  f(x)   at a real point   x   can be defined as the  shadow  of the quotient    ∆ y   /  ∆ x     for  infinitesimal   ∆ x  , where  ∆ y  =  f ( x + ∆ x ) -  f ( x ) . Here the natural extension of   f   to the hyperreals is still denoted   f  . Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen. ,  The squaring function   f ( x ) =  x  2   is differentiable at   x  = 3 , and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as   h   approaches zero of the difference quotient of   f (3) : ,  The last expression shows that the difference quotient equals   6  +  h   when   h  ≠ 0  and is undefined when   h  = 0 , because of the definition of the difference quotient. However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when   h  = 0 . The limit is the result of letting   h   go to zero, meaning it is the value that  6 +  h   tends to as   h   becomes very small: ,  Hence the slope of the graph of the squaring function at the point  (3, 9)  is 6, and so its derivative at   x  = 3  is   f ′(3) = 6 . ,  More generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the squaring function at   x  =  a   is   f ′( a ) = 2 a  : ,  If   y  =  f ( x )  is  differentiable  at   a  , then   f   must also be  continuous  at   a  . As an example, choose a point   a   and let   f   be the  step function  that returns a value, say 1, for all   x   less than   a  , and returns a different value, say 10, for all   x   greater than or equal to   a  .   f   cannot have a derivative at   a  . If   h   is negative, then   a  +  h   is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from   a   to   a  +  h   is very steep, and as   h   tends to zero the slope tends to infinity. If   h   is positive, then   a  +  h   is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from   a   to   a  +  h   has slope zero. Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.  [Note 2]   ,  However, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there. For example, the  absolute value  function   y  = |  x  |  is continuous at   x  = 0 , but it is not differentiable there. If   h   is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to   h   is one, whereas if   h   is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to   h   is negative one. This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at   x  = 0 . Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its  tangent is vertical : For instance, the function   y  =  x  1/3   is not differentiable at   x  = 0 . ,  In summary: for a function   f   to have a derivative it is   necessary   for the function   f   to be continuous, but continuity alone is not   sufficient  . ,  Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at  almost every  point. Early in the  history of calculus , many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a  monotone function  or a  Lipschitz function , this is true. However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. This example is now known as the  Weierstrass function . In 1931,  Stefan Banach  proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a  meager set  in the space of all continuous functions.  [2]   Informally, this means that hardly any continuous functions have a derivative at even one point. ,  Let   f   be a function that has a derivative at every point   a   in the  domain  of   f  . Because every point   a   has a derivative, there is a function that sends the point   a   to the derivative of   f   at   a  . This function is written   f  ′( x )  and is called the  derivative function  or the  derivative  of   f  . The derivative of   f   collects all the derivatives of   f   at all the points in the domain of   f  . ,  Sometimes   f   has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain. The function whose value at   a   equals   f  ′( a )  whenever   f  ′( a )  is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of   f  . It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of   f  . ,  Using this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an  operator  whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions. If we denote this operator by   D  , then   D ( f )  is the function   f  ′( x ) . Since   D ( f )  is a function, it can be evaluated at a point   a  . By the definition of the derivative function,   D ( f )( a ) =  f  ′( a ) . ,  For comparison, consider the doubling function   f ( x ) = 2 x  ;   f   is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs: ,  The operator   D  , however, is not defined on individual numbers. It is only defined on functions: ,  Because the output of   D   is a function, the output of   D   can be evaluated at a point. For instance, when   D   is applied to the squaring function,   x  ↦  x  2  ,   D   outputs the doubling function   x  ↦ 2 x  , which we named   f ( x ) . This output function can then be evaluated to get   f (1) = 2 ,   f (2) = 4 , and so on. ,  Let   f   be a differentiable function, and let   f  ′( x )  be its derivative. The derivative of   f  ′( x )  (if it has one) is written   f  ′′( x )  and is called the   second derivative  of  f  . Similarly, the derivative of a second derivative, if it exists, is written   f  ′′′( x )  and is called the   third derivative  of  f  . Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the   n  th derivative as the derivative of the  ( n -1) th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called  higher-order derivatives . The   n  th derivative is also called the  derivative of order   n   . ,  If   x ( t )  represents the position of an object at time   t  , then the higher-order derivatives of   x   have physical interpretations. The second derivative of   x   is the derivative of   x ′( t ) , the velocity, and by definition this is the object\\'s  acceleration . The third derivative of   x   is defined to be the  jerk , and the fourth derivative is defined to be the  jounce . ,  A function   f   need not have a derivative, for example, if it is not continuous. Similarly, even if   f   does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative. For example, let ,  Calculation shows that   f   is a differentiable function whose derivative is ,    f ′(x)   is twice the absolute value function, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have   k   derivatives for any non-negative integer   k   but no  ( k  + 1) th-order derivative. A function that has   k   successive derivatives is called   k  times differentiable . If in addition the   k  th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of  differentiability class    C k   . (This is a stronger condition than having   k   derivatives. For an example, see  differentiability class .) A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called  infinitely differentiable  or   smooth  . ,  On the real line, every  polynomial function  is infinitely differentiable. By standard  differentiation rules , if a polynomial of degree   n   is differentiated   n   times, then it becomes a  constant function . All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero. In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions. ,  The derivatives of a function   f   at a point   x   provide polynomial approximations to that function near   x  . For example, if   f   is twice differentiable, then ,  in the sense that ,  If   f   is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the  Taylor series  for   f   evaluated at   x  +  h   around   x  . ,  A point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an  inflection point .  [3]   At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point   x  = 0  of the function   y  =  x  3  , or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point   x  = 0  of the function   y  =  x  1/3  . At an inflection point, a function switches from being a  convex function  to being a  concave function  or vice versa. ,  The symbols dx, dy, and dx/dy were introduced by  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  in 1675.   [4]   It is still commonly used when the equation   y  =  f ( x )  is viewed as a functional relationship between  dependent and independent variables . Then the first derivative is denoted by ,  and was once thought of as an  infinitesimal  quotient. Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation ,  for the  n th derivative of   y  =  f ( x )  (with respect to  x ). These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example, ,  With Leibniz\\'s notation, we can write the derivative of  y  at the point   x  =  a   in two different ways: ,  Leibniz\\'s notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially relevant for  partial differentiation . It also makes the  chain rule  easy to remember:  [Note 3]   ,  Sometimes referred to as  prime notation ,  [5]   one of the most common modern notation for differentiation is due to  Joseph-Louis Lagrange  and uses the  prime mark , so that the derivative of a function  f ( x ) is denoted  f ′( x ) or simply  f ′. Similarly, the second and third derivatives are denoted ,  To denote the number of derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in  superscript , whereas others place the number in parentheses: ,  The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation  f   ( n )  for the  n th derivative of  f  – this notation is most useful when we wish to talk about the derivative as being a function itself, as in this case the Leibniz notation can become cumbersome. ,   Newton\\'s notation  for differentiation, also called the dot notation, places a dot over the function name to represent a time derivative. If   y  =  f ( t ) , then ,  denote, respectively, the first and second derivatives of  y  with respect to  t . This notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or  arc length . It is very common in  physics ,  differential equations , and  differential geometry .  [6]    [7]   While the notation becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives, in practice only few derivatives are needed. ,   Euler \\'s notation uses a  differential operator   D , which is applied to a function  f  to give the first derivative  Df . The second derivative is denoted  D  2  f , and the  n th derivative is denoted  D   n   f . ,  If   y  =  f ( x )  is a dependent variable, then often the subscript  x  is attached to the  D  to clarify the independent variable  x . Euler\\'s notation is then written ,  although this subscript is often omitted when the variable  x  is understood, for instance when this is the only variable present in the expression. ,  Euler\\'s notation is useful for stating and solving  linear differential equations . ,  The derivative of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using  rules  for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones. ,  Most derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions. The following incomplete list gives some of the most frequently used functions of a single real variable and their derivatives. ,  where  r  is any  real number , then ,  wherever this function is defined. For example, if    \\n \\n \\n \\n f \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n = \\n \\n x \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n / \\n \\n 4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{1/4}} \\n \\n    , then ,  and the derivative function is defined only for positive  x , not for   x  = 0 . When   r  = 0 , this rule implies that  f ′( x ) is zero for   x  ≠ 0 , which is almost the constant rule (stated below). ,  In many cases, complicated limit calculations by direct application of Newton\\'s difference quotient can be avoided using differentiation rules. Some of the most basic rules are the following. ,  The derivative of ,  is ,  Here the second term was computed using the  chain rule  and third using the  product rule . The known derivatives of the elementary functions  x  2 ,  x  4 , sin( x ), ln( x ) and  exp( x ) =  e   x   , as well as the constant 7, were also used. ,  A  vector-valued function   y ( t ) of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some  vector space   R   n  . A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions  y  1 ( t ),  y  2 ( t ), …,  y   n  ( t ), meaning that   y ( t ) = ( y  1 ( t ), ...,  y   n  ( t )) . This includes, for example,  parametric curves  in  R  2  or  R  3 . The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them. The derivative of  y ( t ) is defined to be the  vector , called the  tangent vector , whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions. That is, ,  Equivalently, ,  if the limit exists. The subtraction in the numerator is subtraction of vectors, not scalars. If the derivative of  y  exists for every value of  t , then  y ′ is another vector valued function. ,  If  e  1 , …,  e   n   is the standard basis for  R   n  , then  y ( t ) can also be written as   y  1 ( t ) e  1  + … +  y   n  ( t ) e   n   . If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the  linearity  property, then the derivative of  y ( t ) must be ,  because each of the basis vectors is a constant. ,  This generalization is useful, for example, if  y ( t ) is the position vector of a particle at time  t ; then the derivative  y ′( t ) is the  velocity  vector of the particle at time  t . ,  Suppose that  f  is a function that depends on more than one variable—for instance, ,   f  can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables: ,  In other words, every value of  x  chooses a function, denoted  f x  , which is a function of one real number.  [Note 4]   That is, ,  Once a value of  x  is chosen, say  a , then   f ( x ,  y )  determines a function  f a   that sends  y  to   a  2  + ay +  y  2  : ,  In this expression,  a  is a  constant , not a  variable , so  f a   is a function of only one real variable. Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies: ,  The above procedure can be performed for any choice of  a . Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of  f  in the  y  direction: ,  This is the partial derivative of  f  with respect to  y . Here  ∂  is a rounded  d  called the  partial derivative symbol . To distinguish it from the letter  d , ∂ is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\". ,  In general, the  partial derivative  of a function   f ( x  1 , …,  x   n  )  in the direction  x i   at the point ( a  1  …,  a   n  ) is defined to be: ,  In the above difference quotient, all the variables except  x i   are held fixed. That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable ,  and, by definition, ,  In other words, the different choices of  a  index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above. This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives. ,  An important example of a function of several variables is the case of a  scalar-valued function    f ( x  1 , ...,  x   n  )  on a domain in Euclidean space  R   n   (e.g., on  R  2  or  R  3 ). In this case  f  has a partial derivative ∂ f /∂ x   j   with respect to each variable  x   j  . At the point  a , these partial derivatives define the vector ,  This vector is called the   gradient   of  f  at  a . If  f  is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function ∇ f  that takes the point  a  to the vector ∇ f ( a ). Consequently, the gradient determines a  vector field . ,  If  f  is a real-valued function on  R  n , then the partial derivatives of  f  measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes. For example, if  f  is a function of  x  and  y , then its partial derivatives measure the variation in  f  in the  x  direction and the  y  direction. They do not, however, directly measure the variation of  f  in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line   y  =  x  . These are measured using directional derivatives. Choose a vector ,  The  directional derivative  of  f  in the direction of  v  at the point  x  is the limit ,  In some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector. Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector. To see how this works, suppose that   v  = λ u  . Substitute   h  =  k /λ  into the difference quotient. The difference quotient becomes: ,  This is λ times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of  f  with respect to  u . Furthermore, taking the limit as  h  tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as  k  tends to zero because  h  and  k  are multiples of each other. Therefore,   D   v  ( f ) = λ D   u  ( f ) . Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors. ,  If all the partial derivatives of  f  exist and are continuous at  x , then they determine the directional derivative of  f  in the direction  v  by the formula: ,  This is a consequence of the definition of the  total derivative . It follows that the directional derivative is  linear  in  v , meaning that   D   v  +  w  ( f ) =  D   v  ( f ) +  D   w  ( f ) . ,  The same definition also works when  f  is a function with values in  R  m . The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors. In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in  R  m . ,  When  f  is a function from an open subset of  R   n   to  R   m  , then the directional derivative of  f  in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to  f  at that point and in that direction. But when   n  &gt; 1 , no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of  f . The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once. That is, for any vector  v  starting at  a , the linear approximation formula holds: ,  Just like the single-variable derivative,   f \\u2009′( a )  is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible. ,  If  n  and  m  are both one, then the derivative   f \\u2009′( a )  is a number and the expression   f \\u2009′( a ) v   is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for   f \\u2009′( a )  to be a number. If it were a number, then   f \\u2009′( a ) v   would be a vector in  R   n   while the other terms would be vectors in  R   m  , and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense,   f \\u2009′( a )  must be a function that sends vectors in  R   n   to vectors in  R   m  , and   f \\u2009′( a ) v   must denote this function evaluated at  v . ,  To determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as ,  Notice that if we choose another vector  w , then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting  w  for  v . It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both  w  for  v  and   a  +  v   for  a . By subtracting these two new equations, we get ,  If we assume that  v  is small and that the derivative varies continuously in  a , then   f \\u2009′( a  +  v )  is approximately equal to   f \\u2009′( a ) , and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with   v  +  w   substituted for  v . The linear approximation formula implies: ,  This suggests that   f \\u2009′( a )  is a  linear transformation  from the vector space  R   n   to the vector space  R   m  . In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations. Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times || v ||, where the constant is independent of  v  but depends continuously on  a . Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities. In particular,   f \\u2009′( a )  is a linear transformation up to a small error term. In the limit as  v  and  w  tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as  v  goes to zero,   f \\u2009′( a )  must be a linear transformation. ,  In one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients. However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain  R   m   while the denominator lies in the domain  R   n  . Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator. To make precise the idea that   f \\u2009′( a )  is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If   f \\xa0:  R  →  R  , then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of  f  at  a  is the unique number   f \\u2009′( a )  such that ,  This is equivalent to ,  because the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero. This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with  norms . ,  The definition of the  total derivative  of  f  at  a , therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation   f \\u2009′( a )\\xa0:  R   n   →  R   m    such that ,  Here  h  is a vector in  R   n  , so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on  R   n  . However,  f ′( a ) h  is a vector in  R   m  , and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on  R   m  . If  v  is a vector starting at  a , then   f \\u2009′( a ) v   is called the  pushforward  of  v  by  f  and is sometimes written   f  ∗  v  . ,  If the total derivative exists at  a , then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of  f  exist at  a , and for all  v ,   f \\u2009′( a ) v   is the directional derivative of  f  in the direction  v . If we write  f  using coordinate functions, so that   f  = ( f  1 ,  f  2 , ...,  f   m  ) , then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a  matrix . This matrix is called the   Jacobian matrix   of  f  at  a : ,  The existence of the total derivative  f ′( a ) is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on  a . ,  The definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable. That is, if  f  is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists. The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1×1 matrix whose only entry is the derivative  f ′( x ). This 1×1 matrix satisfies the property that   f ( a  +  h ) −  f ( a ) −  f \\u2009′( a ) h   is approximately zero, in other words that ,  Up to changing variables, this is the statement that the function    \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n ↦  \\n f \\n ( \\n a \\n ) \\n + \\n \\n f \\n ′ \\n \\n ( \\n a \\n ) \\n ( \\n x \\n −  \\n a \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x\\\\mapsto f(a)+f\\'(a)(x-a)} \\n \\n     is the best linear approximation to  f  at  a . ,  The total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case. This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function. Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the  tangent bundle  of the source to the tangent bundle of the target. ,  The natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a  jet , cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors. It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the  jet bundle . The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the  k th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to  k . ,  By repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the  Fréchet derivative , specialized to  R   p  . The  k th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map ,  which takes a point  x  in  R  n  and assigns to it an element of the space of  k -linear maps from  R  n  to  R  m  – the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense)  k -linear approximation to  f  at that point. By precomposing it with the  diagonal map  Δ,   x  → ( x ,  x ) , a generalized Taylor series may be begun as ,  where f( a ) is identified with a constant function,   x   i   −  a   i    are the components of the vector   x  −  a  , and  ( Df )  i    and  ( D  2  f )  jk    are the components of   Df   and   D  2  f   as linear transformations. ,  The concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings.

[1]   If such a limit exists, the sequence is called  convergent . A sequence which does not converge is said to be  divergent .  [2]   The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of  analysis  ultimately rests.  [1]   ,  Limits can be defined in any  metric  or  topological space , but are usually first encountered in the  real numbers . ,   ,   ,  The Greek philosopher  Zeno of Elea  is famous for formulating  paradoxes that involve limiting processes . ,   Leucippus ,  Democritus ,  Antiphon ,  Eudoxus  and  Archimedes  developed the  method of exhaustion , which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a  geometric series . ,   Newton  dealt with series in his works on  Analysis with infinite series  (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711),  Method of fluxions and infinite series  (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and  Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum  (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his  Optiks ). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of ( x + o )  n   which he then linearizes by  taking limits  (letting  o →0). ,  In the 18th century,  mathematicians  such as  Euler  succeeded in summing some  divergent  series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century,  Lagrange  in his  Théorie des fonctions analytiques  (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus.  Gauss  in his etude of  hypergeometric series  (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit. ,  The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index  N  so that ...) was given by  Bernhard Bolzano  ( Der binomische Lehrsatz , Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by  Karl Weierstrass  in the 1870s. ,  In the  real numbers , a number    \\n \\n \\n \\n L \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle L} \\n \\n     is the  limit  of the  sequence     \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle (x_{n})} \\n \\n     if the numbers in the sequence become closer and closer to    \\n \\n \\n \\n L \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle L} \\n \\n     and not to any other number. ,  We call    \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x} \\n \\n     the  limit  of the  sequence     \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle (x_{n})} \\n \\n     if the following condition holds: ,  In other words, for every measure of closeness    \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\epsilon } \\n \\n    , the sequence\\'s terms are eventually that close to the limit. The sequence    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle (x_{n})} \\n \\n     is said to  converge to  or  tend to  the limit    \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x} \\n \\n    , written    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n →  \\n x \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x_{n}\\\\to x} \\n \\n     or    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n lim \\n \\n n \\n →  \\n ∞  \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n = \\n x \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\lim _{n\\\\to \\\\infty }x_{n}=x} \\n \\n    . ,  Symbolically, this is: ,  If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is  convergent ; otherwise it is  divergent . ,  Example of a sequence which converges to the limit    \\n \\n \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle a} \\n \\n    . ,  Regardless which    \\n \\n \\n \\n ε  \\n &gt; \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varepsilon &gt;0} \\n \\n     we have, there is an index    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle N_{0}} \\n \\n    , so that the sequence lies afterwards completely in the epsilon tube    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n a \\n −  \\n ε  \\n , \\n a \\n + \\n ε  \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle (a-\\\\varepsilon ,a+\\\\varepsilon )} \\n \\n    . ,  There is also for a smaller    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n &gt; \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\epsilon _{1}&gt;0} \\n \\n     an index    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle N_{1}} \\n \\n    , so that the sequence is afterwards inside the epsilon tube    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n a \\n −  \\n \\n ε  \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n , \\n a \\n + \\n \\n ε  \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle (a-\\\\varepsilon _{1},a+\\\\varepsilon _{1})} \\n \\n    . ,  For each    \\n \\n \\n \\n ε  \\n &gt; \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varepsilon &gt;0} \\n \\n     there are only finitely many sequence members outside the epsilon tube. ,  Limits of sequences behave well with respect to the usual  arithmetic operations .

In fact, any real-valued  function   f  is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences (though this is not necessarily true when using more general notions of continuity). ,  Some other important properties of limits of real sequences include the following (provided, in each equation below, that the limits on the right exist). ,  These properties are extensively used to prove limits without the need to directly use the cumbersome formal definition.

Similarly,    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n →  \\n −  \\n ∞  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x_{n}\\\\to -\\\\infty } \\n \\n     if, for every  K , there is an  N  such that, for every    \\n \\n \\n \\n n \\n ≥  \\n N \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle n\\\\geq N} \\n \\n    ,    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n &lt; \\n K \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x_{n}&lt;K} \\n \\n    . If a sequence tends to infinity, or to minus infinity, then it is divergent (however, a divergent sequence need not tend to plus or minus infinity: take for example    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n = \\n ( \\n −  \\n 1 \\n \\n ) \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x_{n}=(-1)^{n}} \\n \\n    ). ,  A point  x  of the  metric space  ( X ,  d ) is the  limit  of the  sequence  ( x n  ) if, for all ε &gt; 0, there is an  N  such that, for every    \\n \\n \\n \\n n \\n ≥  \\n N \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle n\\\\geq N} \\n \\n    ,    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n , \\n x \\n ) \\n &lt; \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle d(x_{n},x)&lt;\\\\epsilon } \\n \\n    . This coincides with the definition given for real numbers when    \\n \\n \\n \\n X \\n = \\n \\n R \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle X=\\\\mathbb {R} } \\n \\n     and    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n ( \\n x \\n , \\n y \\n ) \\n = \\n \\n | \\n \\n x \\n −  \\n y \\n \\n | \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle d(x,y)=|x-y|} \\n \\n    . ,  For any  continuous function   f , if    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n →  \\n x \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x_{n}\\\\to x} \\n \\n     then    \\n \\n \\n \\n f \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n →  \\n f \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle f(x_{n})\\\\to f(x)} \\n \\n    . In fact, a  function   f  is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences. ,  Limits of sequences are unique when they exist, as distinct points are separated by some positive distance, so for    \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\epsilon } \\n \\n     less than half this distance, sequence terms cannot be within a distance    \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\epsilon } \\n \\n     of both points. ,  A point  x  of the topological space ( X , τ) is the  limit  of the  sequence  ( x n  ) if, for every  neighbourhood   U  of  x , there is an  N  such that, for every    \\n \\n \\n \\n n \\n ≥  \\n N \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle n\\\\geq N} \\n \\n    ,    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ∈  \\n U \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle x_{n}\\\\in U} \\n \\n    . This coincides with the definition given for metric spaces if ( X , d ) is a metric space and    \\n \\n \\n \\n τ  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\tau } \\n \\n     is the topology generated by  d . ,  The limit of a sequence of points    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n : \\n n \\n ∈  \\n \\n N \\n \\n ) \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\left(x_{n}:n\\\\in \\\\mathbb {N} \\\\right)\\\\;} \\n \\n     in a topological space  T  is a special case of the  limit of a function : the domain is    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {N} } \\n \\n     in the space    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n ∪  \\n { \\n + \\n ∞  \\n } \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {N} \\\\cup \\\\lbrace +\\\\infty \\\\rbrace } \\n \\n     with the  induced topology  of the  affinely extended real number system , the range is  T , and the function argument  n  tends to +∞, which in this space is a  limit point  of    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {N} } \\n \\n    . ,  If  X  is a  Hausdorff space  then limits of sequences are unique where they exist. Note that this need not be the case in general; in particular, if two points  x  and  y  are  topologically indistinguishable , any sequence that converges to  x  must converge to  y  and vice versa. ,  A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms ultimately become arbitrarily close together, after sufficiently many initial terms have been discarded. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in  metric spaces , and, in particular, in  real analysis . One particularly important result in real analysis is the  Cauchy criterion for convergence of sequences : A sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. This remains true in other  complete metric spaces . ,  The definition of the limit using the  hyperreal numbers  formalizes the intuition that for a \"very large\" value of the index, the corresponding term is \"very close\" to the limit. More precisely, a real sequence    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n {\\\\displaystyle (x_{n})} \\n \\n     tends to  L  if for every infinite  hypernatural   H , the term  x   H   is infinitely close to  L , i.e., the difference  x   H   -  L  is  infinitesimal . Equivalently,  L  is the  standard part  of  x   H   ,  Thus, the limit can be defined by the formula ,  where the limit exists if and only if the righthand side is independent of the choice of an infinite  H . ]',\n",
       " '[  Edvard Munch  (   /  m  ʊ  ŋ  k  /   ;  [1]    Norwegian:\\xa0   [ˈɛdvɑʈ muŋk]   \\xa0  (   listen )  ; 12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a  Norwegian   painter  and  printmaker  whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main tenets of late 19th-century  Symbolism  and greatly influenced  German Expressionism  in the early 20th century. One of his best known works is   The Scream   of 1893. ,   ,   ,  Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of  Ådalsbruk  in  Løten ,  United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway , to Laura Catherine Bjølstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Both Sophie and Edvard appear to have inherited their artistic talent from their mother. Edvard Munch was related to painter  Jacob Munch  and historian  Peter Andreas Munch .  [2]   ,  The family moved to Christiania (renamed Kristiania in 1877, and now  Oslo ) in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at  Akershus Fortress . Edvard\\'s mother died of  tuberculosis  in 1868, as did Munch\\'s favorite sister Johanne Sophie in 1877.  [3]   After their mother\\'s death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer  Edgar Allan Poe .  [4]   ,  As Edvard remembered it, Christian\\'s positive behavior toward his children was overshadowed by his morbid  pietism . Munch wrote, \"My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born.\"  [5]   Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard\\'s poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him.  [6]   One of Munch\\'s younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding. Munch would later write, \"I inherited two of mankind\\'s most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity.\"  [7]   ,  Christian Munch\\'s military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty.  [3]   They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munch\\'s early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munch\\'s interests.  [8]   At thirteen, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.  [9]   ,  In 1879, Munch enrolled in a  technical college  to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and math. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies.  [10]   The following year, much to his father\\'s disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an \"unholy trade\", and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters.  [11]   In contrast to his father\\'s rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art. He wrote his goal in his diary: \"in my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself.\"  [10]   ,  In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were sculptor  Julius Middelthun  and the  naturalistic  painter  Christian Krohg .  [12]   That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the Academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students.  [13]   His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic\\'s dismissive response: \"It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art.\"  [14]   Munch\\'s nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for  Standing Nude  (1887). They may have been confiscated by his father.  [15]   ,  During these early years, Munch experimented with many styles, including  Naturalism  and  Impressionism . Some early works are reminiscent of  Manet . Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses.  [14]   At one point, however, Munch\\'s father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch\\'s cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.  [16]   ,  Munch also received his father\\'s ire for his relationship with  Hans Jæger , the local nihilist who lived by the code \"a passion to destroy is also a creative passion\" and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom.  [17]   Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. \"My ideas developed under the influence of the  bohemians  or rather under Hans Jæger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of  Strindberg  and the Germans…but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then.\"  [18]   At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called  The City of Free Love .  [19]   Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munch\\'s relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life. ,  After numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jæger\\'s commandment that Munch should \"write his life\", meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his \"soul\\'s diary\".  [20]   This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting   The Sick Child   (1886), based on his sister\\'s death, was his first \"soul painting\", his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another \"violent outburst of moral indignation\" from the community.  [21]   ,  Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him: ,  He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch\\'s pictures are as a rule \"not complete\", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.  [22]   ,  Munch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style.  [23]   His idiom continued to veer between  naturalistic , as seen in  Portrait of Hans Jæger , and  impressionistic , as in  Rue Lafayette . His   Inger On the Beach   (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come.  [24]   He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the  Post-Impressionists , what evolved was a subject matter which was  symbolist  in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter  Léon Bonnat .  [25]   ,  Munch seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that it \"will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!\"  [26]   ,  Munch\\'s younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior  Melancholy: Laura . Amanda O\\'Neill says of the work, \"In this heated claustrophobic scene Munch not only portrays Laura\\'s tragedy, but his own dread of the madness he might have inherited.\"  [27]   ,  Munch arrived in Paris during the festivities of the  Exposition Universelle (1889)  and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists. His picture  Morning  (1884) was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion.  [28]   He spent his mornings at Bonnat\\'s busy studio (which included live female models) and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums (where students were expected to make copies as a way of learning technique and observation).  [29]   Munch recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnat\\'s drawing lessons—\"It tires and bores me—it\\'s numbing\"—but enjoyed the master\\'s commentary during museum trips.  [30]    [31]   ,  Munch was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential:  Paul Gauguin ,  Vincent van Gogh , and  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec —all notable for how they used color to convey emotion.  [31]   Munch was particularly inspired by Gauguin\\'s \"reaction against realism\" and his credo that \"art was human work and not an imitation of Nature\", a belief earlier stated by  Whistler .  [32]   As one of his Berlin friends said later of Munch, \"he need not make his way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature. He carries his own Tahiti within him.\"  [33]   Influenced by Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist  Max Klinger , Munch experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of his works. In 1896 he created his first woodcuts—a medium that proved ideal to Munch\\'s symbolic imagery.  [34]   Together with his contemporary  Nikolai Astrup , Munch is considered an innovator of the woodcut medium in Norway.  [35]   ,  In December 1889 his father died, leaving Munch\\'s family destitute. He returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for his family from then on.  [36]   Christian\\'s death depressed him and he was plagued by suicidal thoughts: \"I live with the dead—my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my father…Kill yourself and then it\\'s over. Why live?\"  [37]   Munch\\'s paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which he experimented with the  pointillist  style of  Georges Seurat .  [38]   ,  By 1892, Munch formulated his characteristic, and original,  Synthetist   aesthetic , as seen in  Melancholy  (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element. Considered by the artist and journalist  Christian Krohg  as the first  Symbolist  painting by a Norwegian artist,  Melancholy  was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo.  [39]   In 1892,  Adelsteen Normann , on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition,  [40]   the society\\'s first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed \"The Munch Affair\"), and after one week the exhibition closed.  [40]   Munch was pleased with the \"great commotion\", and wrote in a letter: \"Never have I had such an amusing time—it\\'s incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.\"  [41]   ,  In Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual  August Strindberg , whom he painted in 1892. During his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would comprise his major work,  The Frieze of Life , first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings.  [42]   He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings.  [43]   Already, Munch was showing a reluctance to part with his paintings, which he termed his \"children\". ,  His other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style.  [44]   Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in  Ashes , the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munch\\'s figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage ( Death in the Sick-Room ), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in  The Scream , Munch\\'s men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. He wrote, \"No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.\"  [45]   ,   The Scream  exists in four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910). There are also several lithographs of  The Scream  (1895 and later). ,  The 1895 pastel sold at auction on 2 May 2012 for US$119,922,500, including commission.  [46]   It is the most colorful of the versions  [47]   and is distinctive for the downward-looking stance of one of its background figures. It is also the only version not held by a Norwegian museum. ,  The 1893 version (shown here) was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and recovered. The 1910 painting was stolen in 2004 from The Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage. ,   The Scream  is Munch\\'s most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.  [45]   Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis. ,  With this painting, Munch met his stated goal of \"the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self\".  [48]   Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: \"I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.\"  [49]   He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, \"for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, \\'The Scream?\\' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.\"  [50]   ,  In summing up the painting\\'s effects, author Martha Tedeschi has stated: \"  Whistler\\'s Mother  , Wood\\'s   American Gothic  , Leonardo da Vinci\\'s   Mona Lisa   and Edvard Munch\\'s  The Scream  have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.\"  [51]   ,  In December 1893,  Unter den Linden  in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munch\\'s work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled  Study for a Series: Love.  This began a cycle he later called the  Frieze of Life—A Poem about Life, Love and Death.  \"Frieze of Life\" motifs, such as  The Storm  and  Moonlight,  are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as  Rose and Amelie  and  Vampire . In  Death in the Sickroom , the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding  Anxiety ,  Ashes ,   Madonna   and  Women in Three Stages  (from innocence to old age).  [52]   ,  Around the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the \"Frieze\". He painted a number of pictures, several of them in larger format and to some extent featuring the  Art Nouveau  aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting  Metabolism  (1898), initially called  Adam and Eve . This work reveals Munch\\'s preoccupation with the \"fall of man\" and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as  The Empty Cross  and  Golgotha  (both c. 1900) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch\\'s pietistic upbringing. The entire  Frieze  was shown for the first time at the  secessionist  exhibition in Berlin in 1902.  [53]   ,  \"The Frieze of Life\" themes recur throughout Munch\\'s work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death.  [54]   These themes are expressed in paintings such as   The Sick Child   (1885),  Love and Pain  (retitled  Vampire ; 1893–94),  Ashes  (1894), and  The Bridge . The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see   Puberty   and  Love and Pain ) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see  Separation ,  Jealousy , and  Ashes ). ,  Munch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity.  [55]   These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist\\'s sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence.  [56]   Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as  Madonna ,  Hands  and  Puberty , and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series.  [57]   Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, \"My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity.\"  [58]   ,  While attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, \"With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.\"  [59]   One of his great supporters in Berlin was  Walther Rathenau , later the German  foreign minister , who strongly contributed to his success. ,  In 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his \"Frieze of Life\" themes. He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch\\'s  Self-Portrait With Skeleton Arm  (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by  Paul Klee .  [60]   Munch also produced multi-colored versions of \"The Sick Child\" which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of  Kiss  (1892)  [60]   Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch\\'s work \"violent and brutal\" but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance.  [61]   His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman\\'s cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of  Åsgårdstrand  in Norway. He dubbed this home the \"Happy House\" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years.  [62]   It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. \"To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here\". ,  In 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, \"A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance.\"  [62]   In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in \"The Frieze of Life\" series,  The Dance of Life  (1899).  [64]   Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: \"Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.\"  [65]   Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin.  [65]   His  Girls on the Jetty , created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations.  [57]   In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing \"a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval.\"  [66]   The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch\\'s work even though the public still found his work alien and strange. ,  The good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and  Max Linde . He described the turn of events in his diary, \"After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me.\"  [67]   However, despite this positive change, Munch\\'s self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings.  [68]   His paintings  Still Life (The Murderess)  and  The Death of Marat I , done in 1906-7, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.  [69]   ,  In 1903-4, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming  Fauvists , famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs.  [70]   After studying the sculpture of  Rodin , Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture.  [71]   During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition.  [72]   In 1906, he painted the screen for an  Ibsen  play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin\\'s  Deutsches Theater , in which the  Frieze of Life  was hung. The theatre\\'s director  Max Reinhardt  later sold it; it is now in the Berlin  Nationalgalerie .  [73]   After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.  [74]   ,  In the autumn of 1908, Munch\\'s anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute. As he later wrote, \"My condition was verging on madness—it was touch and go.\"  [75]   Subject to hallucinations and feelings of persecution, he entered the clinic of Dr. Daniel Jacobson. The  therapy  Munch received for the next eight months included diet and \"electrification\" (a treatment then fashionable for nervous conditions, not to be confused with  electroconvulsive therapy ).  [76]   Munch\\'s stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic. Further brightening his mood, the general public of Kristiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings. He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St. Olav \"for services in art\".  [77]   His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York.  [78]   ,  As part of his recovery, Dr. Jacobson advised Munch to only socialize with good friends and avoid  drinking in public . Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery.  [79]   He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.  [80]   ,  The outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, \"All my friends are German but it is France that I love.\"  [81]   In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement.  [82]   Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work.  [83]   Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the  Spanish Flu , the worldwide pandemic of that year.  [84]   ,  Munch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at  Skøyen , Oslo.  [85]   Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse \"Rousseau\" as a model.  [86]   Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings. He likely had sexual relations with some of them.  [87]   Munch occasionally left his home to paint murals on commission, including those done for the  Freia  chocolate factory.  [88]   ,  To the end of his life, Munch continued to paint unsparing self-portraits, adding to his self-searching cycle of his life and his unflinching series of takes on his emotional and physical states. In the 1930s and 1940s, the  Nazis  labeled Munch\\'s work \" degenerate art \" (along with that of  Picasso ,  Paul Klee ,  Matisse ,  Gauguin  and many other modern artists) and removed his 82 works from German museums.  [89]    Adolf Hitler  announced in 1937, \"For all we care, those prehistoric Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching.\"  [90]   ,  In 1940, the  Germans invaded Norway  and the Nazi party took over the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other eleven were never recovered), including  The Scream  and  The Sick Child , and they too were hidden from the Nazis.  [91]   ,  Munch died in his house at Ekely near Oslo on 23 January 1944, about a month after his 80th birthday. His Nazi-orchestrated funeral suggested to Norwegians that he was a Nazi sympathizer, a kind of appropriation of the independent artist.  [92]   The city of Oslo bought the Ekely estate from Munch\\'s heirs in 1946; his house was demolished in May 1960.  [93]   ,  From my rotting body, \\nflowers shall grow \\nand I am in them \\nand that is eternity. ,  When Munch died, his remaining works were bequeathed to the city of Oslo, which built the  Munch Museum  at  Tøyen  (it opened in 1963). The museum holds a collection of approximately 1,100 paintings, 4,500 drawings, and 18,000 prints, the broadest collection of his works in the world.  [95]   The Munch Museum serves as Munch\\'s official estate,  [95]   and has been active in responding to copyright infringements, as well as clearing copyright for the work, such as the appearance of Munch\\'s  The Scream  in a 2006  M&amp;M\\'s  advertising campaign.  [96]   The U.S. copyright representative for the Munch Museum and the Estate of Edvard Munch is the  Artists Rights Society .  [97]   ,  Munch\\'s art was highly personalized and he did little teaching. His \"private\" symbolism was far more personal than that of other Symbolist painters such as  Gustave Moreau  and  James Ensor . Munch was still highly influential, particularly with the  German Expressionists , who followed his philosophy, \"I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive result of Man\\'s urge to open his heart.\"  [45]   Many of his paintings, including  The Scream , have universal appeal in addition to their highly personal meaning. ,  Munch\\'s works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. His cabin, \"the Happy House\", was given to the municipality of Åsgårdstrand in 1944; it serves as a small Munch Museum. The inventory has been maintained exactly as he left it. ,  One version of  The Scream  was stolen from the National Gallery in 1994. In 2004, another version of  The Scream , along with one of  Madonna , were stolen from the Munch Museum in a daring daylight robbery. All were eventually recovered, but the paintings stolen in the 2004 robbery were extensively damaged. They have been meticulously restored and are on display again. Three Munch works were stolen from the Hotel  Refsnes Gods  in 2005; they were shortly recovered, although one of the works was damaged during the robbery.  [98]   ,  In October 2006, the color  woodcut   Two people. The lonely  ( To mennesker. De ensomme ) set a new record for his prints when it was sold at an auction in Oslo for 8.1 million  NOK  (US$1.27 million). It also set a record for the highest price paid in auction in Norway.  [99]   On 3 November 2008, the painting  Vampire  set a new record for his paintings when it was sold for US$38.162 million at  Sotheby\\'s  New York. ,  Munch\\'s image appears on the Norwegian  1,000 kroner note , along with pictures inspired by his artwork.  [100]   ,  In February 2012, a major Munch exhibition,  Edvard Munch. The Modern Eye,  opened at the  Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt ; the exhibition was opened by  Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway .  [101]    [102]   ,  In May 2012,  The Scream  sold for $119.9 million, and is the  second most expensive artwork ever sold  at an open auction. (It was surpassed in November 2013 by   Three Studies of Lucian Freud  , which sold for $142.4 million).  [103]   ,  In 2013, four of Munch\\'s paintings were depicted in a series of stamps by the  Norwegian postal service , to commemorate the 150th anniversary of his birth in 2014.  [104]   ,  On 14 November 2016 a version of Munch\\'s The Girls on the Bridge sold for US$54.5 million at Sotheby\\'s, New York, making it the second highest price achieved for one of his paintings. [   citation needed   ]  ,  In 1911 the final competition for the decoration of the large walls of the University of Oslo Aula (assembly hall) was held between Munch and  Emanuel Vigeland . The episode is known as the  Aula Controversy . In 1914 Munch was finally commissioned to decorate the Aula and the work was completed in 1916. This major work in Norwegian monumental painting includes 11 paintings covering 223 m 2 .  The Sun ,  History  and  Alma Mater  are the key works in this sequence. Munch declared: “I wanted the decorations to form a complete and independent world of ideas, and I wanted their visual expression to be both distinctively Norwegian and universally human.” In 2014 it was suggested that the Aula paintings have a value of at least 500 million kroner.

       " '[  Vincent Willem van Gogh  ( Dutch:\\xa0   [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑn ˈɣɔx]   \\xa0(      \\xa0  listen   ) ;  [note 1]   30 March 1853\\xa0– 29\\xa0July 1890) was a Dutch  Post-Impressionist  painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860  oil paintings , most of them in the last two years of his life in  France , where he died. They include  landscapes ,  still lifes ,  portraits  and  self-portraits , and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive  brushwork  that contributed to the foundations of  modern art . His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. ,  Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a  Protestant  missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother  Theo  supported him financially, and the two kept up a  long correspondence by letter . His early works, mostly  still lifes  and depictions of  peasant labourers , contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the   avant-garde  , including  Émile Bernard  and  Paul Gauguin , who were reacting against the  Impressionist  sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and  local landscapes . His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in  Arles  in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include  olive trees , cypresses,  wheat fields  and  sunflowers . ,  Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at  Saint-Rémy . After he discharged himself and moved to the  Auberge Ravoux  in  Auvers-sur-Oise  near Paris, he came under the care of the  homeopathic  doctor  Paul Gachet . His depression continued and on 27\\xa0July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later. ,  Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\".  [6]   His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the  Fauves  and  German Expressionists . He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. ,   ,   ,  The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother,  Theo . Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent\\'s thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890.  [8]   Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.  [9]   ,  Theo kept all of Vincent\\'s letters to him;  [10]   Vincent kept few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo\\'s widow  Johanna  arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914.  [11]    [12]   Vincent\\'s letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\",  [9]   and read in parts like autobiography.  [9]   The translator  Arnold Pomerans  wrote that their publication adds a \"fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh\\'s artistic achievement, an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter\".  [13]   ,  There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister  Wil , 58 to the painter  Anthon van Rappard , 22 to  Émile Bernard  as well as individual letters to  Paul Signac ,  Paul Gauguin  and the critic  Albert Aurier . Some are illustrated with  sketches .  [9]   Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from Arles. While there Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French and English.  [14]   There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.  [15]   ,  Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in  Groot-Zundert , in the predominantly Catholic province of  North Brabant  in the southern Netherlands.  [16]   He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the  Dutch Reformed Church , and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth.  [note 2]   Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the  University of Leiden  in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).  [18]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s mother came from a prosperous family in  The Hague ,  [19]   and his father was the youngest son of a minister.  [20]   The two met when Anna\\'s younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus\\'s older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh\\'s parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert.  [21]   His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and  Willemina  (known as \"Wil\"). In later life Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo.  [22]   Van Gogh\\'s mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her.  [23]   Theodorus\\'s salary was modest, but the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family\\'s high social position.  [24]   ,  Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child.  [25]   He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860 was sent to the village school. In 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at  Zevenbergen ,  [26]   where he felt abandoned, and campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866 his parents sent him to the middle school in  Tilburg , where he was deeply unhappy.  [27]   His interest in art began at a young age; encouraged to draw as a child by his mother,  [28]   his early drawings are expressive,  [26]   but do not approach the intensity of his later work.  [29]   Constantijn C. Huysmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh\\'s profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect;  [30]   in March 1868 he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was \"austere and cold, and sterile\".  [31]   ,  In July 1869 Van Gogh\\'s uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers  Goupil &amp; Cie  in The Hague.  [32]   After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil\\'s London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at  87 Hackford Road ,  Stockwell .  [33]   This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo\\'s wife later remarked that this was the best year of his life. He became infatuated with his landlady\\'s daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.  [34]   ,  In April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small  boarding school  in  Ramsgate . When the proprietor moved to  Isleworth  in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him.  [35]    [36]   The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a  Methodist  minister\\'s assistant.  [37]   His parents had meanwhile moved to  Etten ;  [38]   in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in  Dordrecht . He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German.  [39]   He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic.  [40]   According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.  [41]   ,  To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877 the family sent him to live with his uncle  Johannes Stricker , a respected theologian, in Amsterdam.  [42]   Van Gogh prepared for the  University of Amsterdam  theology entrance examination;  [43]   he failed the exam, and left his uncle\\'s house in July 1878. He undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at a  Protestant  missionary school in  Laken , near Brussels.  [44]   ,  In January 1879 he took up a post as a missionary at  Petit-Wasmes .  [45]   in the coal-mining district of  Borinage  in Belgium. To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person, and moved to a small hut where he slept on straw.  [46]   His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for \"undermining the dignity of the priesthood\". He then walked the 75 kilometres (47\\xa0mi) to Brussels,  [47]   returned briefly to  Cuesmes  in the Borinage, but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880,  [note 3]   which caused concern and frustration for his parents. His father was especially frustrated and advised that his son should be committed to the lunatic asylum at  Geel .  [49]    [50]    [note 4]   ,  Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October.  [52]   He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo\\'s suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo\\'s recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist  Willem Roelofs , who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the  Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts . He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of  modelling  and  perspective .  [53]   ,  Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents.  [54]   He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia \"Kee\" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother\\'s older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than him, and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage.  [55]   She refused with the words \"No, nay, never\" (\" nooit, neen, nimmer \").  [56]   After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try and sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin,  Anton Mauve . Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be.  [57]   Mauve invited him to return in a few months, and suggested he spend the intervening time working in  charcoal  and  pastels ; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this advice.  [57]   ,  Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker, which he described to Theo as an attack.  [58]   Within days he left for Amsterdam.  [59]   Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his \"persistence is  disgusting \".  [60]   In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: \"Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame.\"  [60]    [61]   He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee\\'s father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh\\'s inability to support himself.  [62]   ,  Mauve took Van Gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas.  [63]   He quarreled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague.  [note 5]    [66]   Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from  plaster casts .  [67]   Van Gogh could only afford to hire people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved.  [68]   In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of  gonorrhoea  and spent three weeks in hospital.  [69]   Soon after, he first painted in oils,  [70]   bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were.  [71]   ,  By March 1882 Mauve appears to have gone cold towards Van Gogh, and stopped replying to his letters.  [72]   He had learned of Van Gogh\\'s new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute,  Clasina Maria \"Sien\" Hoornik  (1850–1904), and her young daughter.  [73]   Van Gogh had met Sien towards the end of January 1882, when she had a five-year-old daughter and was pregnant. She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this;  [74]   on 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem.  [75]   When Van Gogh\\'s father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him,  [76]   and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883 left Sien and the children.  [77]   ,  Poverty may have pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her daughter to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother.  [78]   Willem remembered visiting  Rotterdam  when he was about 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry in order to legitimise the child.  [79]   He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely.  [80]   Sien drowned herself in the  River Scheldt  in 1904.  [81]   ,  In September 1883 Van Gogh moved to  Drenthe  in the northern Netherlands. In December, driven by loneliness, he went to live with his parents, then in  Nuenen , North Brabant.  [81]   ,  In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and  paintings of weavers  and  their cottages .  [82]   From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour\\'s daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of  strychnine , but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital.  [75]   On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.  [83]   ,  Van Gogh painted several groups of  still lifes  in 1885.  [84]   During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.  [85]   ,  There was interest from a dealer in Paris early in 1885.  [86]   Theo asked Vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit.  [87]   In May, Van Gogh responded with his first major work,   The Potato Eaters  , and a series of \" peasant character studies \" which were the culmination of several years of work.  [88]   When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that they were too dark, and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism.  [85]   In August his work was publicly exhibited for the first time, in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague. One of his  young peasant sitters  became pregnant in September 1885; Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her, and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him.

Art Gallery of Ontario , Toronto ,  He moved to Antwerp that November, and rented a room above a paint dealer\\'s shop in the rue des Images ( Lange Beeldekensstraat ).  [91]   He lived in poverty and ate poorly, preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models. Bread, coffee and  tobacco  became his staple diet. In February 1886 he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful.  [92]   In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of  colour theory  and spent time in museums—particularly studying the work of  Peter Paul Rubens \\xa0– and broadened his palette to include  carmine ,  cobalt blue  and  emerald green . Van Gogh bought Japanese  ukiyo-e  woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings.  [93]   He was drinking heavily again,  [94]   and was hospitalised between February and March 1886,  [95]   when he was possibly also treated for  syphilis .  [96]    [note 6]   ,  After his recovery, and despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the  Academy of Fine Arts  in Antwerp, and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking.  [99]   He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with  Charles Verlat , the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class  Franz Vinck . Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by  Eugène Siberdt . Soon Siberdt and van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt\\'s requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When van Gogh was required to draw the  Venus of Milo  during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to van Gogh\\'s drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: \\'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like,  God damn it!  A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!\\' According to some accounts this was the last time van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris.  [100]   On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.  [101]   ,  Van Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo\\'s rue Laval apartment in  Montmartre , and studied at  Fernand Cormon \\'s studio. In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54  rue Lepic .  [102]   In Paris, Vincent painted  portraits of friends and acquaintances ,  still life paintings , views of  Le Moulin de la Galette ,  scenes in Montmartre ,  Asnières  and along the  Seine . In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at  Japonaiserie , tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine  Paris Illustre ,   The Courtesan or Oiran   (1887), after  Keisai Eisen , which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.  [103]   ,  After seeing the portrait of  Adolphe Monticelli  at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his   Seascape at Saintes-Maries   (1888).  [104]    [105]   Two years later, Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings, and Vincent bought some of Monticelli\\'s works to add to his collection.  [106]   ,  Van Gogh learned about  Fernand Cormon \\'s  atelier  from Theo.  [107]   He worked at the studio in April and May 1886,  [108]   where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist  John Peter Russell ,  [109]   and met fellow students  Émile Bernard ,  Louis Anquetin  and  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec \\xa0– who painted a portrait of him in pastel. They met at  Julien \"Père\" Tanguy \\'s paint shop,  [108]   (which was, at that time, the only place where  Paul Cézanne \\'s paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing  Pointillism  and  Neo-Impressionism  for the first time, and bringing attention to  Georges Seurat  and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.  [110]   ,  Conflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be \"almost unbearable\".  [108]   By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to  Asnières , a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of  complementary colours  – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts.  [87]    [108]   ,   Courtesan  (after  Eisen ), 1887.

In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris.  [111]   Towards the end of the year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris.  [112]   There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like  Camille Pissarro  and his son  Lucien , Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.  [113]   ,  Ill from drink and suffering from smoker\\'s cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.  [14]   He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an  art colony . The Danish artist  Christian Mourier-Petersen  became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The  Zouaves , the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"  [114]   ,  The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh\\'s more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours.  [115]   He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow,  ultramarine  and  mauve . His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including  The Old Mill  (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields.  [116]   This was one of seven canvases sent to  Pont-Aven  on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard,  Charles Laval  and others.  [116]   ,  The portrayals of the Arles landscape are informed by Van Gogh\\'s Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking  perspective , but excel in their use of colour.  [117]   His new-found appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work. In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded \"perspective frame\"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the  Société des Artistes Indépendants . In April, he was visited by the American artist  Dodge MacKnight , who was living nearby at  Fontvieille .  [118]    [119]   On 1 May 1888, for 15  francs  per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the  Yellow House  at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.  [120]   ,  On 7 May Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare,  [121]   having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and  Marie Ginoux . The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.  [122]   He wanted a gallery to display his work, and started a series of paintings that eventually included   Van Gogh\\'s Chair   (1888),   Bedroom in Arles   (1888),   The Night Café   (1888),   Café Terrace at Night   (September 1888),   Starry Night Over the Rhone   (1888), and   Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers   (1888), all intended for the  decoration for the Yellow House .  [123]   ,  Van Gogh wrote that with  The Night Café  he tried \"to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime\".  [124]   When he visited  Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer  in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant –  Paul-Eugène Milliet   [125]   – and painted  boats on the sea and the village .  [126]   MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to  Eugène Boch , a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.  [125]   ,   The Sower with Setting Sun , 1888.

While waiting, in August he painted   Sunflowers  . When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study  The Poet Against a Starry Sky.   [127]    [note 7]   ,  In preparation for Gauguin\\'s visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station\\'s postal supervisor  Joseph Roulin , whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House.  [129]   When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on the   Décoration for the Yellow House ,  probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook.  [130]   He completed two chair paintings:  Van Gogh\\'s Chair  and  Gauguin\\'s Chair.   [131]   ,  After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and in November the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his   The Painter of Sunflowers  ; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin\\'s suggestion. Among these \"imaginative\" paintings is   Memory of the Garden at Etten  .  [132]    [note 8]   Their first joint outdoor venture was at the  Alyscamps , when they produced the pendants   Les Alyscamps  .  [133]   The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was   Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers  .  [134]   ,  Van Gogh and Gauguin visited  Montpellier  in December 1888, where they saw works by  Courbet  and  Delacroix  in the  Musée Fabre .  [135]   Their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of \"excessive tension\", rapidly headed towards crisis point.

Gauguin claimed, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour.  [138]   Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially.  [139]   It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave.  [139]   The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House.  [140]   Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left the house for a walk, and \"rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand\".  [140]   This account is uncorroborated;  [141]   Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.  [140]   ,  After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh returned to his room, where he was assaulted by  voices  and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ),  [note 9]   causing severe bleeding.  [142]   He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented.  [142]   Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital,  [145]    [146]   where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed.  [140]   ,  Van Gogh had no recollection of the event, suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown.  [147]   The hospital diagnosis was \"acute mania with generalised delirium\",  [148]   and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care.  [149]    [150]   Gauguin immediately notified Theo, who on 24 December had proposed marriage to his old friend  Andries Bonger \\'s sister Johanna.  [151]   That evening Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles. He arrived on Christmas Day, comforted Vincent who seemed to be semi-lucid. That evening he left Arles for the return trip to Paris.  [152]   ,  During the first days of his treatment, Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to \"be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him.\"  [153]   Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.  [154]   ,  Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889.  [155]   He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and  delusions  of poisoning.  [156]   In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as \"le fou roux\" ( the redheaded madman );  [149]   Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March;  [157]   in April Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home.  [158]   Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in  Saint-Rémy-de-Provence . Around this time, he wrote, \"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\"  [159]   ,  Van Gogh gave his 1889  Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey  to Dr Rey. The physician was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop, then gave it away.  [160]   In 2016, the portrait was housed at the  Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts  and estimated to be worth over $50 million.

Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, less than 30 kilometres (19\\xa0mi) from Arles, and was run by a former naval doctor,  Théophile Peyron . Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which was to be used as a studio.  [162]   The clinic and  its garden  became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital\\'s interiors, such as  Vestibule of the Asylum  and  Saint-Rémy (September 1889) . Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as   The Starry Night  . He was allowed short supervised walks, which led to paintings of  cypresses  and olive trees, including   Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889,    Cypresses 1889,   Cornfield with Cypresses  (1889),  Country road in Provence by Night  (1890). In September 1889 he produced two further versions of  Bedroom in Arles .  [163]   ,  Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh was left to work on  interpretations of other artist\\'s paintings , such as  Millet \\'s  The Sower  and  Noonday Rest , as well as variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the  Realism  of  Jules Breton ,  Gustave Courbet  and Millet,  [164]   and he compared his copies to a musician\\'s interpreting  Beethoven .  [165]   ,  His  The Round of the Prisoners  (1890) was painted after an  engraving  by  Gustave Doré  (1832–1883). Tralbaut suggests that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself;  [166]    Jan Hulsker  discounts this.  [167]   ,  Between February and April 1890 Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse. Depressed and unable to bring himself to write, he was still able to paint and draw a little during this time,  [168]   and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases \"from memory\\xa0...  reminisces of the North \".  [169]   Among these was  Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset . Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh\\'s illness had a significant effect on his work.  [170]   Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches.  [171]   Belonging to this period is   Sorrowing Old Man (\"At Eternity\\'s Gate\")  , a colour study Hulsker describes as \"another unmistakable remembrance of times long past\".  [90]    [172]   His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, according to the art critic  Robert Hughes , \"longing for concision and grace\".

Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo   [90]   ,   Albert Aurier  praised his work in the   Mercure de France   in January 1890, and described him as \"a genius\".  [173]   In February Van Gogh painted five versions of   L\\'Arlésienne  (Madame Ginoux) , based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888.  [174]    [note 10]   Also in February, Van Gogh was invited by   Les XX  , a society of  avant-garde  painters in Brussels, to participate in  their annual exhibition . At the opening dinner a  Les XX  member,  Henry de Groux , insulted Van Gogh\\'s work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh\\'s honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group. Later, while Van Gogh\\'s exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris,  Claude Monet  said that his work was the best in the show.  [175]   After the birth of his nephew, Van Gogh wrote, \"I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of  white almond blossom  against a blue sky.\"  [176]   ,  In May 1890 Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both  Dr Paul Gachet  in  Auvers-sur-Oise  and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists –  Camille Pissarro  had recommended him. Van Gogh\\'s first impression was that Gachet was \"iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let\\'s say just as much.\"  [177]   ,  The painter  Charles Daubigny  moved to Auvers in 1861, and in turn drew other artists there, including  Camille Corot  and  Honoré Daumier . In July 1890, Van Gogh completed two paintings of   Daubigny\\'s Garden  , one of which is likely his final work.  [178]   ,  During his last weeks, at Saint-Rémy, his thoughts returned to \" memories of the North \",  [169]   and several of the approximately 70 oils, painted during as many days in Auvers-sur-Oise, are reminiscent of northern scenes.  [179]   In June 1890, he painted several portraits of his doctor, including   Portrait of Dr Gachet  , and his only  etching . In each the emphasis is on Gachet\\'s melancholic disposition.  [180]   There are other paintings which are probably unfinished, including   Thatched Cottages by a Hill .   [178]   ,  In July, Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\".  [181]   He had first become captivated by the fields in May, when the wheat was young and green. In July he described to Theo \"vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies\".  [182]   ,  He wrote that they represented his \"sadness and extreme loneliness\", and that the \"canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside\".  [183]     Wheatfield with Crows  , from July 1890, is a painting Hulsker discusses as being associated with \"melancholy and extreme loneliness\".  [184]   Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings from Auvers that follow the completion of  Wheatfield with Crows .  [185]   ,  On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a 7mm  Lefaucheux  à broche  revolver .  [186]    [187]   There were no witnesses and he died 30 hours after the incident.  [160]   The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn.  [188]   The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the  Auberge Ravoux , where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning Theo rushed to his brother\\'s side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent\\'s last words were: \"The sadness will last forever\".  [189]    [190]    [191]    [192]   ,  Van Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh,  Andries Bonger ,  Charles Laval ,  Lucien Pissarro , Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet, among twenty family, friends and locals. Theo had been ill, and his health began to decline further after his brother\\'s death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent\\'s absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at  Den Dolder , and was buried in Utrecht.  [193]   In 1914,  Johanna van Gogh-Bonger  had Theo\\'s body  exhumed  and moved from Utrecht to be re-buried alongside Vincent\\'s at Auvers-sur-Oise.  [194]   ,  There have been numerous debates as to the nature of  Van Gogh\\'s illness  and its effect on his work, and many  retrospective diagnoses  have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning.  [195]   Perry was the first to suggest  bipolar disorder  in 1947,  [196]   and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer.  [197]    [198]   Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with  acute intermittent porphyria , noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious.  [195]    Temporal lobe epilepsy  with bouts of depression has also been suggested.  [198]   Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.  [198]   ,  Van Gogh drew and painted with  watercolours  while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged.  [199]   When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh\\'s work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures\\xa0– highly elaborate studies in black and white,  [note 11]   which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.  [201]   ,  In August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working   en plein air  . Vincent wrote that he could now \"go on painting with new vigour\".  [202]   From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known  Hague School  artists like  Weissenbruch  and  Blommers , and received technical advice from them, as well as from painters like  De Bock  and  Van der Weele , both artists of the Hague School\\'s second generation.  [203]   When he moved to Nuenen after the period in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them.  The Potato Eaters  and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived.  [203]   Following a visit to the  Rijksmuseum , Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick, economical brushwork of the  Dutch Masters , especially  Rembrandt  and  Frans Hals .  [204]    [note 12]   He was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise,  [203]   so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skills.  [205]   ,  Theo criticised  The Potato Eaters  for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style.  [206]   During Van Gogh\\'s stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His   Portrait of Père Tanguy   (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette, and is evidence of an evolving personal style.  [207]    Charles Blanc \\'s treatise on colour interested him greatly, and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that \"colour expresses something in itself\".  [208]    [209]   According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a \"psychological and moral weight\", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of   The Night Cafe  , a work he wanted to \"express the terrible passions of humanity\".  [210]   Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.  [211]   ,  Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature,  [212]   and during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.  [213]   His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols.  [214]   His renditions of the sower, at first copied from  Jean-François Millet , reflect Van Gogh\\'s religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun.  [215]   These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop.  [216]   His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian  iconography  he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life.  [217]   In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint  The Sower .  [208]   ,  Van Gogh stayed within what he called the \"guise of reality\",  [218]   and was critical of overly stylised works.  [219]   He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of  Starry Night  had gone too far and that reality had \"receded too far in the background\".  [219]   Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of  Hokusai \\'s   Great Wave  , the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below, and the painter\\'s vision is \"translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint\".  [220]   ,  Between 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an  oeuvre ,  [221]   a collection that reflected his personal vision, and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc\\'s definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.  [222]   He painted many series of studies;  [218]   most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.  [223]   The work in Arles contributed considerably to his  oeuvre : those he thought the most important from that time were  The Sower ,  Night Cafe ,   Memory of the Garden in Etten   and  Starry Night . With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.  [219]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill.  [224]   Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.  [225]   ,  The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He believed they were \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\"  [223]    [226]   He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism.  [227]   Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.  [228]   ,  In December 1888 he painted  La Berceuse  – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours.  [219]   It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of  Portrait of the Postman  to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in  Madame Roulin with Baby .  [229]   ,   Portrait of Artist\\'s Mother , October 1888,  Norton Simon Museum of Art , Pasadena, California ,    Eugène Boch , (The Poet Against a Starry Sky) , 1888, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris ,   Portrait of the Postman Joseph Roulin  (1841–1903) early August 1888,  Museum of Fine Arts, Boston  ,   La Berceuse (Augustine Roulin)  1889, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston ,  Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889.  [230]    [note 13]   They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death.  [231]   Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.  [223]    [232]   ,  The self-portraits reflect an unusually high degree of self-scrutiny.  [233]   Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life, for example the mid-1887 Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of  Claude Monet ,  Paul Cezanne  and Signac.  [234]   In  Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat , heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas. It is one of his most renowned self-portraits of that period, \"with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes, and the novel halo derived from the Neo-Impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a \\'purposeful\\' canvas\".  [235]   ,  They contain a wide array of  physiognomical  representations.  [230]   Van Gogh\\'s mental and physical condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.  [230]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s gaze is seldom directed at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin.  [232]   Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter.  [230]   Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.

His Saint-Rémy self-portraits show his side with the unmutilated ear, as he saw himself in the mirror ,   Self-Portrait Without Beard , c. September 1889. This painting may have been Van Gogh\\'s last self-portrait. He gave it to his mother as a birthday gift.  [238]    [239]   ,  Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses,  lilacs ,  irises , and  sunflowers . Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese  ukiyo-e .  [240]   There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles, and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light.  [241]   Both are built from  thickly layered paintwork , which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the \"texture of the seed-heads\".  [242]   ,  In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin,  [134]   who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, \"I\\'m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won\\'t surprise you when it\\'s a question of painting large sunflowers\\xa0... If I carry out this plan there\\'ll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it\\'s a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"  [243]   ,  The sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin\\'s visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the   Yellow House\\'s guest room   in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions.  [134]   After Gauguin\\'s departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the  Berceuse Triptych , and included them in his   Les XX  in Brussels exhibit . Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.

[246]   He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death.  [214]   The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground.  [247]   Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he went on to say, \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\"  [248]   ,  In mid-1889, and at his sister Wil\\'s request, Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of   Wheat Field with Cypresses  .  [249]   The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include  The Starry Night , in which cypresses dominate the foreground.  [246]   ,  Other works from this period include   Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background   (1889, about which in a letter to his brother Van Gogh wrote, \"At last I have a landscape with olives\"  [250]  ),  Cypresses  (1889),  Cypresses with Two Figures  (1889–90), and   Road with Cypress and Star   (1890).  [250]   While in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh spent time outside the asylum, where he painted trees in the olive groves. In these works natural life is rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world, which are, according to Hughes, filled with \"a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation\".

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York ,  The   Flowering Orchards   (also the  Orchards in Blossom ) are among the first groups of work completed after Van Gogh\\'s arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\".  [251]   Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I\\'ve spoiled\".  [252]   ,  During this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner.  [251]   Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including   View of Arles, Flowering Orchards  .  [253]   Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the  Mediterranean climate  his palette significantly brightened.  [254]   ,   The Pink Orchard  also  Orchard with Blossoming Apricot Trees , March 1888.

Neue Pinakothek , Munich ,  Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including  The Old Mill  (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond.  [116]   At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in  The Wheat Field  series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.  [255]   ,  Many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of Van Gogh\\'s death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns.  [256]    [257]   Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\".  [181]   ,  Van Gogh was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. His  Wheatfields at Auvers with White House  shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues, which creates a sense of idyllic harmony.  [258]   ,  About 10 July 1890 Van Gogh wrote to Theo of \"vast fields of wheat under troubled skies\".  [259]     Wheatfield with Crows   shows the artist\\'s state of mind in his final days; Hulsker describes the work as a \"doom-filled painting with threatening skies and ill-omened crows\".  [184]   Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes convey a sense of menace.

[261]   In 1887  André Antoine  hung Van Gogh\\'s alongside works of  Georges Seurat  and  Paul Signac , at the  Théâtre Libre  in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy.  [262]   In 1889 his work was described in the journal   Le Moderniste Illustré   by Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\".  [263]   Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890.  [264]   ,  After Van Gogh\\'s death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at   Les XX  ; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels.  [264]   In 1892  Octave Mirbeau  wrote that Van Gogh\\'s suicide was an \"infinitely sadder loss for art\\xa0... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived.\"  [262]   ,  Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent\\'s most vocal and well-connected champion.  [265]   Theo\\'s widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband or her brother-in law very long and who suddenly had to take care of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh.  [261]    [note 14]   Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh\\'s reputation, and Johanna\\'s brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work.  [261]   Aurier, one of Van Gogh\\'s earliest supporters among the critics, died of  typhoid fever  in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.  [267]   ,  In 1892 Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh\\'s paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894 the  Durand-Rue Gallery  in Paris agreed to take 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh\\'s estate.  [267]   In 1896, the  Fauvist painter   Henri Matisse , then an unknown art student, visited  John Peter Russell  on  Belle Île  off Brittany.  [268]    [269]   Russell had been a close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman\\'s work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by Van Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.  [269]    [270]   ,  In Paris in 1901 a large Van Gogh retrospective was held at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, which excited  André Derain  and  Maurice de Vlaminck , and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism.  [267]   Important group exhibitions took place with the  Sonderbund  artists in Cologne in 1912, the  Armory Show , New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914.  [271]    Henk Bremmer  was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh,  [272]   and introduced  Helene Kröller-Müller  to Van Gogh\\'s art; she became an avid collector of his work.  [273]   The early figures in  German Expressionism  such as  Emil Nolde  acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh\\'s work.  [274]   Bremmer assisted  Jacob Baart de\\xa0la\\xa0Faille , whose   catalogue raisonné    L\\'Oeuvre de Vincent van Gogh  appeared in 1928.  [275]    [note 15]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before  World War I ,  [278]   helped by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914.  [279]   His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind.  [9]   These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young.  [280]   In 1934 the novelist  Irving Stone  published an account of Van Gogh\\'s life titled   Lust for Life  , based on Van Gogh\\'s letters to Theo. This book and the  1956 film of the same name  further enhanced his fame.  [281]   ,  In 1957  Francis Bacon  based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh\\'s  The Painter on the Road to Tarascon , the original of which was destroyed during the  Second World War . Bacon was inspired by an image he described as \"haunting\", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh\\'s theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: \"[R]eal painters do not paint things as they are\\xa0... [T]hey paint them as  they themselves  feel them to be.\"  [282]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s works are among the world\\'s  most expensive paintings . Those sold for over  US$ 100\\xa0million (today\\'s equivalent) include  Portrait of Dr Gachet ,  [283]     Portrait of Joseph Roulin   and  Irises . The  Metropolitan Museum of Art \\'s version of   Wheat Field with Cypresses   was acquired in 1993 for US$57\\xa0million.  [284]   In 2015   L\\'Allée des Alyscamps   sold for US$66.3\\xa0million at Sotheby\\'s, New York, exceeding its reserve of US$40\\xa0million.  [285]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978),  [286]   inherited the estate after his mother\\'s death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection.  [287]   Theo\\'s son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect  Gerrit Rietveld  was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964  Kisho Kurokawa  took charge.  [288]   Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.  [286]   ,  The  Van Gogh Museum  opened in the  Museumplein  in Amsterdam in 1973.  [289]   It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the  Rijksmuseum , regularly receiving more than 1.5 million visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9 million;  [290]   85 percent of the visitors come from other countries.  [291]   ]',\n",
       " '[  Jan Alojzy Matejko  ( Polish pronunciation:\\xa0   [jan aˈlɔjzɨ maˈtɛjko]   \\xa0(      \\xa0  listen   ) ; also known as  Jan Mateyko ; June 24, 1838  [nb 1]   – November 1, 1893) was a Polish  painter  known for paintings of notable historical Polish political and military events.  [2]    [3]   His works include large  oil on canvas  paintings like   Rejtan   (1866),   Union of Lublin   (1869) or   Battle of Grunwald   (1878), numerous portraits, a gallery of  Polish kings , and  murals  in  St. Mary\\'s Basilica, Kraków . He is counted among the most famous  Polish painters .  [2]    [3]    [4]   ,  Matejko spent most of his life in  Kraków . His teachers at the  Kraków Academy of Fine Arts  included  Wojciech Korneli Stattler  and  Władysław Łuszczkiewicz . Later, he became a director at this institution, which eventually was renamed the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts. A number of his students became prominent painters themselves, including  Maurycy Gottlieb ,  Jacek Malczewski ,  Józef Mehoffer  and  Stanisław Wyspiański . ,   ,   ,  Matejko was born on June 24, 1838, in the  Free City of Kraków .  [2]   His father,  Franciszek Ksawery Matejko  ( Czech :   František Xaver Matějka  ) (born 1789 or January 13, 1793, died October 26, 1860), a Czech from the village of  Roudnice , was a graduate of the  Hradec Králové  school who later became a tutor and  music teacher .  [2]   He first worked for the Wodzicki family in Kościelniki, Poland, then moved to  Kraków , where he married the half-German, half-Polish Joanna Karolina Rossberg (Rozberg).  [2]   Jan was the ninth child of eleven children.  [5]   He grew up in a  kamienica  building on  Floriańska Street .  [6]   After the death of his mother in 1845, Jan and his siblings were cared for by his maternal aunt, Anna Zamojska.  [5]   ,  At a young age he witnessed the  Kraków revolution  of 1846 and the 1848  siege of Kraków  by the Austrians, the two events which ended the existence of the  Free City of Kraków .  [2]   His two older brothers served in these battles, under General  Józef Bem ; one died and the other was forced into exile.  [2]   Matejko attended  St. Ann\\'s High School , but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades.  [7]   From his earliest days Matejko showed artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic areas.  [7]   He never mastered a foreign language.  [8]   Despite that and because of his exceptional talent he studied at the  School of Fine Arts in Kraków  from 1852 to 1858.  [2]   His teachers included  Wojciech Korneli Stattler  and  Władysław Łuszczkiewicz .  [9]   He selected  historical painting  as his specialization, and finished his first major work,  Tsars Shuyski before Zygmunt III  ( Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III ), in 1853 (he would return to this topic in a year before his death, in 1892  [10]  ).  [9]    [11]   During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the  Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts  (starting with 1855).  [11]   His seminal project for his graduation in 1858 was   Sigismund I the Old  ennobles the professors of the  Jagiellonian University   ( Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego ).  [12]   ,  After graduation,  [12]   Matejko received a scholarship in 1859 to study with  Hermann Anschütz  at the  Academy of Fine Arts, Munich .  [11]   The following year he received a scholarship to study at the  Academy of Fine Arts Vienna  as well, but after a few days and a major quarrel with  Christian Ruben , Matejko returned to Kraków.  [13]   and opened a studio at his family home in Floriańska Street.  [13]   It would however be years before he would gain commercial success; for a time he was the proverbial \"starving artist\", who celebrated when he sold a canvas (the  Tsars Shuyski... ) for five  gulden .  [2]   ,  In 1860 Matejko published an illustrated album,   Clothing in Poland   ( Ubiory w Polsce ), a project reflecting his intense interest in historical records of all kinds and his desire to promote such interest among Polish people, to intensify their patriotism.  [13]   His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings,  Death of Wapowski during the crowning of Henry Valois  ( Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego , 1861) and  Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka  ( Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki , 1862), which settled his debts.  [14]   In 1862 he finished a painting,   Stańczyk  . Initially received without much applause, in time this would become known as one of Matejko\\'s most famous masterpieces.  [15]   It marks a visible transition in Matejko\\'s art style, from simply illustrating history to creating a philosophical and moral commentary of it.  [13]   ,  During the  January Uprising  of 1863, in which he did not participate because of poor health, Matejko gave financial support, donating most of his savings to the cause, and personally  transported arms  to the insurgents\\' camp.  [13]   His   Skarga\\'s Sermon   ( Kazanie Skargi ), finished in May 1864, was displayed in the gallery of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, which gained him much publicity.  [13]   On 5 November that year, in recognition for his contributions to recreating historical themes, he became a member of the  Kraków Scientific Society  ( Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie ).  [16]   Soon afterward, on 21 November, he married  Teodora Giebultowska , with whom he would have five children: Beata,  Helena , Tadeusz, Jerzy and Regina.  [13]   Helena, his daughter, also an artist, helped victims in  World War I  and was awarded the  Cross of Independence  by  president   Stanisław Wojciechowski .  [17]   ,  At that time Matejko started to gain international recognition. In 1865 Matejko\\'s painting  Skarga\\'s Sermon  was awarded a gold medal at the yearly Paris salon; soon afterwards Count  Maurycy Potocki  \\xa0( pl )  bought it for 10,000 guldens.  [2]   In 1867, his painting   Rejtan   was awarded a gold medal at the  World Exhibition  in Paris and acquired by Emperor  Franz Joseph I of Austria  for 50,000 franks.  [18]    [19]   His next major painting was the   Union of Lublin   ( Unia Lubelska ), created in the years 1867-1869. Once again applauded in Paris, it won Matejko a Cross of the French  Légion d\\'honneur .  [20]   and was purchased by the  Sejm of Galicia .  [21]    Union...  was followed by   Stefan Batory at Pskov   ( Stefan Batory pod Pskowem ), finished in 1871.  [20]   In 1872 he visited  Istanbul  in the  Ottoman Empire , and upon his return to Kraków finished   Astronomer Copernicus, or Conversations with God   ( Astronom Kopernik, czyli rozmowa z Bogiem ), which was acquired by the  Jagiellonian University .  [20]   From the 1870s he was aided in many tasks by a secretary,  Marian Gorzkowski , who would become his \"right hand\", his closest friend, a model for a number of paintings, and an author of memoirs about Matejko.  [21]    [22]   ,  In 1872 during an exhibition in  Prague  he was offered a directorship of the  Academy of Fine Arts, Prague , and soon afterwards, a similar position at Kraków\\'s School of Fine Arts.  [20]   He accepted the Kraków offer, and was for many years the principal ( rector ) of the Academy of Fine Arts.  [20]   In 1874 he finished   Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta   ( The Hanging of the Sigismund bell ).  [23]   In 1878 he finished another masterpiece,   Battle of Grunwald  .  [21]   That year he received an \"honorary grand gold\" medal in Paris, and the city council of Kraków presented him with a ceremonial  scepter , a symbol of his \"royal status in fine arts\".  [21]   In 1879 he finished   Rok 1863 - Polonia   (Year 1863 - Polonia), his take on the  January Uprising  of that time. Begun in 1864, a year after the Uprising he himself had lived through and where he lost a number of friends and family members, this canvas languished unfinished until prince  Władysław Czartoryski  became interested in acquiring it; it is still considered unfinished.  [13]    [24]    [25]   ,  Years 1880-1882 marked his work on another large painting,   Prussian Tribute   ( Hołd Pruski ).  [21]   Matejko gifted this painting to \"the Polish nation\", and it earned him  honorary citizenship  of Kraków; one of the squares in the city was also named  Matejko Square .  [21]   In 1883 he finished   Sobieski at Vienna   ( Sobieski pod Wiedniem ).  [11]    [21]    Sobieski...  was gifted to  Pope Leo XIII  as a \"gift of the Polish nation\" and Matejko, who was one of the members of the group delivering it, received a Knight Commander with Star  Order of Pius IX .  [26]   At that time he also became a vocal spokesman in a number of political issues, publishing letters on issues such as  Polish-Russian relations .  [26]   Another arena he was very engaged in were efforts to protect and reconstruct various historical monuments in the city of Kraków.  [27]   In 1886, he finished a painting about French rather than about Polish history:   Virgin of Orléans  , portraying  Joan of Arc .  [26]    [28]   ,  Next year Matejko received a  Doctor of Philosophy  degree,  honoris causa , from the  Jagiellonian University , and the Austrian   Litteris et Artibus  .  [26]   In 1888 he finished   Batte of Racławice   ( Bitwa pod Racławicami ).  [26]   In 1888-1899, to justify his new academic title, he published a cycle of twelve sketches with an accompanying commentary,   History of civilization in Poland   ( Dzieje Cywilizacji w Polsce ).  [23]    [26]   From 1890 to 1892 he published another cycle of sketches, this time of  Polish kings  (  Poczet królów i książąt polskich   -  Fellowship of the kings and princes of Poland ), which over the years became so popular that its portraits are seen as the canon portrayals of their subjects.  [26]    [29]   1891 saw him finishing   Constitution of the 3 May   ( Konstytucja 3 Maja ).  [26]   He then began composing another large painting,   Oaths of Jan Kazimierz   ( Śluby Jana Kazimierza ), but it remained unfinished due to his death.  [26]   In 1892, a year before his death, he finished a   Self-portrait   ( Autoportret ).  [26]   ,  Matejko suffering from a  peptic ulcer , and died in Kraków on November 1 that year of internal bleeding.  [27]   His funeral on November 5 drew large crowds, and his death was mentioned in at least thirty two European newspapers.  [30]   He was buried in the Kraków\\'s  Rakowicki Cemetery .  [27]   ,  He is counted among the most famous  Polish painters ,  [2]    [3]   described as \"Poland\\'s greatest historical painter\"  [4]   and \"a cult figure to the nation at large... [already] by the time of his death.\".  [23]   His style was praised for being \"colourful, detailed and imaginative\".  [23]   He succeeded in propagating Polish history, and reminding the world about Poland, while his country remained partitioned and without any independent political representation.  [2]   His works, disseminated in thousands of reproductions, have become almost standard illustrations of many key events in  Polish history .  [2]    [3]   His 1860 illustrated album  Ubiory w Polsce  (Clothing in Poland) is seen as a valuable historical reference.  [31]   Critics of his work have pointed to his use of traditional painting style (\"antiquarian realism\", \"theatrical effects\").  [32]   At exhibitions abroad the nuanced historical context of his works would be often lost on foreign audiences.  [11]    [23]   Occasionally his paintings would cause controversy; for example  Rejtan  offended a number of prominent members of Polish nobility, who saw the painting as an indictment of their entire social class.  [20]    [23]   His paintings were subject to censorship in the  Russian Empire , and  Nazi Germany  planned to destroy  Battle of Grunwald  and the  Prussian Homage , which the Nazi authorities considered offensive to the German view of history (those paintings were among many that the Germans planned to purposefully destroy in their  war on Polish culture ; both were however successfully hidden by the members of  Poland resistance ).  [33]   ,  Many of his works are dedicated to famous events in Polish history. Matejko was focusing on major themes in Polish history and using historical sources to paint events in minute historical detail.  [34]   His earliest paintings are simple historical paintings with no hidden messages.  [13]   The later ones, starting with the painting   Stańczyk   (1862), are intended to inspire the viewers with a patriotic message.  [13]    [35]    Stańczyk  focuses on the court jester, portrayed as a symbol of country\\'s conscience, sitting in a chair in the background of a party - a sole figure reflecting on the war, ignored by the joyful crowd.  [23]   ,  In addition to history paintings Matejko made also numerous portraits.  [26]   Among others: portraits of Jagiellonian University rectors  Józef Szujski  and  Stanisław Tarnowski , and numerous portraits of family and friends, including  Wife in the wedding dress  (\"Żona w sukni ślubnej\") (1865, destroyed by his wife during a quarrel and recreated in 1879) and a self-portrait (1892).  [26]   Altogether Matejko authored 320  oil paintings  and several thousands  drawings  and  watercolors . [   citation needed   ]  He also designed the  polychrome  in  St. Mary\\'s Basilica, Kraków  (1889–1891).  [36]   ,  His paintings are on display in numerous Polish museums; including the  National Museum in Warsaw ,  National Museum in Kraków ,  National Museum in Poznań  and  National Museum in Wrocław .  [27]   National Museum in Kraków has a branch dedicated to Matejko -  House of Jan Matejko  ( Dom Jana Matejki ) located in his former studio and family house at Floriańska Street, opened in 1898.  [27]    [37]   Another museum dedicated to Matejko,  Dworek Jana Matejki , opened in  Krzesławice  (where Matejo acquired a  manor   [21]  ) in 1865.  [38]   ,  Over 80 painters have been Matejko\\'s students at some point, many influenced during his tenure as the director of the Kraków School of Fine Arts, and are referred to as members of \"Matejko School\".  [23]    [39]   Prominent among them are  Maurycy Gottlieb ,  [39]    Ephraim Moses Lilien ,  [40]    Jacek Malczewski ,  [39]    Józef Mehoffer ,  [39]    Antoni Piotrowski ,  [39]    Witold Pruszkowski ,  [39]    Leon Wyczółkowski ,  [39]   and  Stanisław Wyspiański .  [39]   ,  The following is a selected list of Matejko\\'s works, in a chronological order. ]',\n",
       " '[  Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy  (   /  ˈ  t  oʊ  l  s  t  ɔɪ  ,   ˈ  t  ɒ  l  -  /   ;  [1]    Russian :  Лев Никола́евич Толсто́й,  Lev Nikolajevič Tolstoj  ,  pronounced\\xa0   [lʲɛf nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪtɕ tɐlˈstoj]   \\xa0(      \\xa0  listen   ) ; 9 September\\xa0[ O.S.  28 August]\\xa01828 – 20 November\\xa0[ O.S.  7 November]\\xa01910), usually referred to in English as  Leo Tolstoy , was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. ,  Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels   War and Peace   (1869) and   Anna Karenina   (1877), often cited as pinnacles of  realist  fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy,   Childhood  ,   Boyhood  , and   Youth   (1852–1856), and   Sevastopol Sketches   (1855), based upon his experiences in the  Crimean War . Tolstoy\\'s fiction includes dozens of short stories and several  novellas  such as   The Death of Ivan Ilyich  ,   Family Happiness  , and   Hadji Murad  . He also wrote  plays  and numerous philosophical essays. ,  In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work   A Confession  . His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the  Sermon on the Mount , caused him to become a fervent  Christian anarchist  and  pacifist . Tolstoy\\'s ideas on  nonviolent resistance , expressed in such works as   The Kingdom of God Is Within You  , were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as  Mohandas Gandhi ,  [2]    Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  [3]   and  James Bevel . Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of  Georgism , the economic philosophy of  Henry George , which he incorporated into his writing, particularly   Resurrection  . ,   ,   ,  Tolstoy was born at  Yasnaya Polyana , a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5\\xa0mi) southwest of  Tula, Russia , and 200 kilometers (120\\xa0mi) south of  Moscow . The  Tolstoys  were a well-known family of old  Russian nobility , tracing their ancestry to a noble named Indris from the  Lithuanian empire  in 1353.  [4]    [5]   He was the fourth of five children of  Count  Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy, a veteran of the  Patriotic War of 1812 , and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (Volkonskaya). Tolstoy\\'s parents died when he was young, so he and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at  Kazan University . His teachers described him as \"both unable and unwilling to learn.\"  [6]   Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much of his time in Moscow and  Saint Petersburg . In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the  Caucasus  and joined the  army . It was about this time that he started writing. ,  His conversion from a dissolute and privileged society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his latter days was brought about by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed the same path were  Alexander Herzen ,  Mikhail Bakunin  and  Peter Kropotkin . During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that would mark the rest of his life. Writing in a letter to his friend  Vasily Botkin : \"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere.\"  [7]   Tolstoy\\'s concept of  non-violence  or  Ahimsa  was bolstered when he read a  German  version of the  Tirukkural . He later instilled the concept in  Mahatma Gandhi  through his  A Letter to a Hindu  when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.  [8]   ,  His European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met  Victor Hugo , whose literary talents Tolstoy praised after reading Hugo\\'s newly finished   Les Misérables  . The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo\\'s novel and Tolstoy\\'s   War and Peace   indicates this influence. Tolstoy\\'s political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Apart from reviewing Proudhon\\'s forthcoming publication,  La Guerre et la Paix  ( War and Peace  in French), whose title Tolstoy would borrow for his masterpiece, the two men discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\" ,  Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for children of Russia\\'s peasants, who had just been  emancipated from serfdom in 1861 . Tolstoy described the school\\'s principles in his 1862 essay \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\".  [9]   Tolstoy\\'s educational experiments were short-lived, partly due to harassment by the  Tsarist  secret police. However, as a direct forerunner to  A. S. Neill \\'s  Summerhill School , the school at Yasnaya Polyana  [10]   can justifiably be claimed the first example of a coherent theory of  democratic education . ,  On September 23, 1862, Tolstoy married  Sophia Andreevna Behrs , who was 16 years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends.  [11]   They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:  [12]   ,  The marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son.  [11]   Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom to compose  War and Peace  and  Anna Karenina  with Sonya acting as his secretary, proofreader and financial manager.  [11]   ,  However, their later life together has been described by  A. N. Wilson  as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy\\'s relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works. ,  The Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the  1905 Russian Revolution  and the subsequent establishment of the  Soviet Union , and Leo Tolstoy\\'s relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Among them are Swedish singer  Viktoria Tolstoy  and Swedish landowner Christopher  Paus ,  Herresta . ,  Tolstoy is one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels   War and Peace   and   Anna Karenina   and novellas such as   Hadji Murad   and   The Death of Ivan Ilyich  . His contemporaries paid him lofty tributes.  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  thought him the greatest of all living novelists.  Gustave Flaubert , on reading a translation of  War and Peace , exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\"  Anton Chekhov , who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic  Matthew Arnold  opined that \"a novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life\".  [13]   ,  Later critics and novelists continue to bear testament to Tolstoy\\'s art.  Virginia Woolf  declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\"  [13]    James Joyce  noted that, \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\".  Thomas Mann  wrote of Tolstoy\\'s seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature\". Such sentiments were shared by the likes of  Proust ,  Faulkner  and  Nabokov . The latter heaped superlatives upon   The Death of Ivan Ilyich   and  Anna Karenina ; he questioned, however, the reputation of  War and Peace , and sharply criticized   Resurrection   and   The Kreutzer Sonata  . ,  Tolstoy\\'s earliest works, the autobiographical novels   Childhood  ,   Boyhood  , and   Youth   (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner\\'s son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy\\'s own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up. ,  Tolstoy served as a  second lieutenant  in an artillery regiment during the  Crimean War , recounted in his   Sevastopol Sketches  . His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent  pacifism  and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.  [14]   ,  His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.  [15]     The Cossacks   (1863) describes the  Cossack  life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl.  Anna Karenina  (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in  War and Peace , Levin in  Anna Karenina  and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in  Resurrection . ,   War and Peace  is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of  Napoleon , from the court of  Alexander I of Russia  to the battlefields of  Austerlitz  and  Borodino . Tolstoy\\'s original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the  Decembrist revolt , to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that  Andrei Bolkonsky \\'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy\\'s theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider  War and Peace  to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the  realist  school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.  [16]    War and Peace  (which is to Tolstoy really an  epic  in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that  Anna Karenina  was his first true novel.  [17]   ,  After  Anna Karenina , Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as  The Death of Ivan Ilyich  (1886) and   What Is to Be Done?   develop a radical  anarcho-pacifist  Christian philosophy which led to his  excommunication  from the  Russian Orthodox Church  in 1901.  [18]   For all the praise showered on  Anna Karenina  and  War and Peace , Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.  [19]   ,  In his novel   Resurrection  ,  Tolstoy  attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of  Georgism , of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life. ,  After reading  Schopenhauer \\'s   The World as Will and Representation  , Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I\\'ve never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\"  [20]   ,  In Chapter VI of   A Confession  , Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer\\'s work. It explained how the nothingness that results from complete  denial of self  is only a relative nothingness, and is not to be feared. The novelist was struck by the description of Christian,  Buddhist , and  Hindu  ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer\\'s ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: ,  But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for  eternal salvation  is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ( Matthew 19:24 ): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose  voluntary poverty  when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus  Buddha   Sakyamuni  was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant\\'s staff; and  Francis of Assisi , the founder of the  mendicant orders  who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \" La povertà  (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.  [21]   ,  In 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called \" What I Believe \", in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in  Jesus Christ \\'s  teachings  and was particularly influenced by the  Sermon on the Mount , and the injunction to  turn the other cheek , which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of  pacifism  and  nonviolence . In his work  The Kingdom of God Is Within You , he explains that he considered mistaken the Church\\'s doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ\\'s teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American  Quakers  who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as  George Fox ,  William Penn  and  Jonathan Dymond . Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the consequences of being a pacifist, and the apparently inevitable waging of war by government, are the reason why he is considered a philosophical anarchist. ,  Later, various versions of \"Tolstoy\\'s Bible\" would be published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.  [22]   ,  Tolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner self-perfection through following the  Great Commandment  of loving one\\'s neighbor and God rather than looking outward to the Church or state for guidance. His belief in  nonresistance  when faced by conflict is another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ\\'s teachings. By directly influencing  Mahatma Gandhi  with this idea through his work   The Kingdom of God Is Within You   (full text of English translation  available on Wikisource ), Tolstoy\\'s profound influence on the nonviolent resistance movement reverberates to this day. He believed that the aristocracy were a burden on the poor, and that the only solution to how we live together is through  anarchism . [   citation needed   ]  ,  He also opposed  private property  in land ownership  [23]   and the institution of marriage and valued the ideals of chastity and sexual abstinence (discussed in   Father Sergius   and his preface to  The Kreutzer Sonata ), ideals also held by the young Gandhi. Tolstoy\\'s later work derives a passion and verve from the depth of his austere moral views.  [24]   The sequence of the temptation of Sergius in  Father Sergius , for example, is among his later triumphs. Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before himself and Chekhov and that Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Other later passages of rare power include the personal crises that were faced by the protagonists of  The Death of Ivan Ilyich , and of   Master and Man  , where the main character in the former or the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists\\' lives. ,  Tolstoy had a profound influence on the development of  Christian anarchist  thought.  [25]   The  Tolstoyans  were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy\\'s companion,  Vladimir Chertkov  (1854–1936), to spread Tolstoy\\'s religious teachings. Philosopher  Peter Kropotkin  wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the   1911 Encyclopædia Britannica  : ,  Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries,  Chojecki ,  Denk  and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the  state  and  property rights , deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in  The Kingdom of God Is Within You ) a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present  property laws . He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.  [26]   ,  During the  Boxer Rebellion  in China, Tolstoy praised the Boxers. He was harshly critical of the atrocities committed by the Russians, Germans, and other western troops. He accused them of engaging in slaughter when he heard about the lootings, rapes, and murders, in what he saw as Christian brutality. Tolstoy also named the two monarchs most responsible for the atrocities;  Nicholas II of Russia  and  Wilhelm II of Germany .  [27]    [28]   Tolstoy, a famous  sinophile , also read the works of Chinese thinker and philosopher,  Confucius .  [29]    [30]    [31]   Tolstoy corresponded with the Chinese intellectual  Gu Hongming  and recommended that China remain an agrarian nation and warned against reform like what Japan implemented. ,  The Russian and American intervention in the Boxer Rebellion was denounced by Tolstoy as were the conflicts in the Philippines by America. The words  terrible for its injustice and cruelty  were used to describe the Czarist intervention by Tolstoy.  [32]   Confucius\\'s works were studied by Tolstoy. The attack on China in the Boxer Rebellion was railed against be Tolstoy.  [33]   The war against China was criticized by Leonid Andreev and Gorkey.  to the Chinese people , an epistle was written by Tolstoy as part of the criticism of the war by intellectuals in Russia.  [34]   The activities of Russia in China by Nicholas II were described in an open letter where they were slammed and denounced by Leo Tolstoy in 1902.  [35]   Tolstoy corresponded with  Gu Hongming  and both they opposed the  Hundred Day\\'s Reform  by  Kang Youwei  and agreed that the reform movement was perilous.  [36]   Tolstoys\\' ideology on non violence shaped the anarchist thought of the Society for the Study of Socialism in China.  [37]   Lao Zi and Confucius\\'s teachings were studied by Tolstoy.  Chinese Wisdom\\'  was a text written by Tolstoy. The Boxer Rebellion stirred Tolstoy\\'s interest in Chinese philosophy.  [38]   The Boxer and Boxer wars were denounced by Tolstoy.  [39]   ,  In hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by  Kropotkin  and  Proudhon  to his readers, whilst rejecting anarchism\\'s espousal of  violent revolutionary means . In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy\", he wrote; \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about  anarchist violence , Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of  anarchist thinkers in Russia , and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin\\'s \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.  [40]   ,  Tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of  Henry George , incorporating it approvingly into later works such as   Resurrection   (1899), the book that played a major factor in his excommunication.  [41]   ,  In 1908, Tolstoy wrote   A Letter to a Hindu    [42]   outlining his belief in non-violence as a means for India to gain independence from British colonial rule. In 1909, a copy of the letter was read by Gandhi, who was working as a lawyer in South Africa at the time and just becoming an activist. Tolstoy\\'s letter was significant for Gandhi, who wrote Tolstoy seeking proof that he was the real author, leading to further correspondence between them.  [43]   ,  Reading Tolstoy\\'s  The Kingdom of God Is Within You  also convinced Gandhi to avoid violence and espouse  nonviolent resistance , a debt Gandhi acknowledged in his autobiography, calling Tolstoy \"the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced\". The correspondence between Tolstoy and Gandhi would only last a year, from October 1909 until Tolstoy\\'s death in November 1910, but led Gandhi to give the name Tolstoy Colony to his second  ashram  in South Africa.  [44]   Besides nonviolent resistance, the two men shared a common belief in the merits of  vegetarianism , the subject of several of Tolstoy\\'s essays.  [45]   ,  Tolstoy also became a major supporter of the  Esperanto  movement. Tolstoy was impressed by the pacifist beliefs of the  Doukhobors  and brought their persecution to the attention of the international community, after they burned their weapons in peaceful protest in 1895. He aided the Doukhobors in migrating to Canada.  [46]   In 1904, during the  Russo-Japanese War , Tolstoy condemned the war and wrote to the Japanese Buddhist priest  Soyen Shaku  in a failed attempt to make a joint pacifist statement. ,  Towards the end of his life, Tolstoy become more and more occupied with the economic theory and social philosophy of  Georgism .  [47]    [48]    [49]    [50]   He spoke of great admiration of  Henry George , stating once that \"People do not argue with the teaching of George; they simply do not know it. And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching, for he who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree.\"  [51]   He also wrote a preface to George\\'s   Social Problems  .  [52]   Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income of the passive Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy so heavily criticized) whilst simultaneously both rejecting a centrally planned  socialist  economy. Some assume that this development in Tolstoy\\'s thinking was a move away from his  anarchist  views, since Georgism requires a central administration to collect  land rent  and spend it on infrastructure. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have also been proposed since.  [53]   Tolstoy\\'s 1899 novel  Resurrection  explores his thoughts on Georgism in more detail and hints that Tolstoy indeed had such a view. It suggests the possibility of small communities with some form of local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods; whilst still heavily criticising institutions of the  state  such as the  justice system . ,  Tolstoy died in 1910, at the age of 82. Just prior to his death, his health had been a concern of his family, who were actively engaged in his care on a daily basis. During his last few days, he had spoken and written about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he had finally gathered the nerve to separate from his wife, and left home in the middle of winter, in the dead of night.  [54]   His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape unannounced from Sophia\\'s jealous tirades. She was outspokenly opposed to many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of the attention which it seemed to her Tolstoy lavished upon his  Tolstoyan  \"disciples\". ,  Tolstoy died of  pneumonia   [55]   at  Astapovo  train station, after a day\\'s rail journey south.  [56]   The station master took Tolstoy to his apartment, and his personal doctors were called to the scene. He was given injections of  morphine  and  camphor . ,  The police tried to limit access to his funeral procession, but thousands of peasants lined the streets. Still, some were heard to say that, other than knowing that \"some nobleman had died\", they knew little else about Tolstoy.  [57]   ,  According to some sources, Tolstoy spent the last hours of his life preaching love, nonviolence, and  Georgism  to his fellow passengers on the train.  [58]   ,  A 2009 film about Tolstoy\\'s final year,   The Last Station  , based on the novel by  Jay Parini , was made by director  Michael Hoffman  with  Christopher Plummer  as Tolstoy and  Helen Mirren  as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for  Oscars  for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including   Departure of a Grand Old Man  , made in 1912 just two years after his death,  How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were  (1913), and  Leo Tolstoy , directed by and starring  Sergei Gerasimov  in 1984. ,  There is also a famous lost film of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer  Burton Holmes  visited Yasnaya Polyana with  Albert J. Beveridge , the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge\\'s advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that documentary evidence of a meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge\\'s chances of running for the U.S. presidency.

       " '[  Franz Kafka   [a]   (3 July 1883\\xa0– 3 June 1924) was a  German-language  novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of  20th-century literature . His work, which fuses elements of  realism  and the  fantastic ,  [3]   typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of  alienation ,  existential anxiety ,  guilt , and  absurdity .  [4]   His best known works include \"  Die Verwandlung  \" (\"The Metamorphosis\"),    Der Process    ( The Trial ), and    Das Schloss    ( The Castle ). The term  Kafkaesque  has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.  [5]   ,  Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking  Jewish  family in  Prague , the capital of the  Kingdom of Bohemia , then part of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire , today part of the  Czech Republic . He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education he was employed with an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from  tuberculosis . ,  Few of Kafka\\'s works were published during his lifetime: the story collections    Betrachtung    ( Contemplation ) and    Ein Landarzt    ( A Country Doctor ), and individual stories (such as \" Die Verwandlung \") were published in literary magazines but received little public attention. Kafka\\'s unfinished works, including his novels   Der Process  ,   Das Schloss   and    Amerika    (also known as   Der Verschollene  ,  The Man Who Disappeared ), were ordered by Kafka to be destroyed by his friend  Max Brod , who nonetheless ignored his friend\\'s direction and published them after Kafka\\'s death. His work went on to influence a vast range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers during the 20th century. ,   ,   ,  Kafka was born near the  Old Town Square  in Prague, then part of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire . His family were middle-class  Ashkenazi Jews . His father, Hermann Kafka (1854–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka,  [6]    [7]   a   shochet   or  ritual slaughterer  in  Osek , a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near  Strakonice  in southern Bohemia.  [8]   Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fancy goods and clothing retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a  jackdaw  (  kavka   in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as  kafka ) as his business logo.  [9]   Kafka\\'s mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in  Poděbrady ,  [10]   and was better educated than her husband.  [6]   ,  Kafka\\'s parents probably spoke a German influenced by  Yiddish  that was sometimes pejoratively called  Mauscheldeutsch , but, as the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak  High German .  [11]   Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest.  [12]   Franz\\'s two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (\"Ellie\") (1889–1944), Valerie (\"Valli\") (1890–1942) and  Ottilie  (\"Ottla\") (1892–1943). They all died during the  Holocaust  of World War II. Valli was deported to the  Łódź Ghetto  in Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favorite sister.  [13]   ,  Hermann is described by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a \"huge, selfish, overbearing businessman\"  [14]   and by Franz Kafka as \"a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature\".  [15]   On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12\\xa0hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka\\'s childhood was somewhat lonely,  [16]   and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka\\'s troubled relationship with his father is evident in his    Brief an den Vater    ( Letter to His Father ) of more than 100\\xa0pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father\\'s authoritarian and demanding character;  [17]   his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy.  [18]   The dominating figure of Kafka\\'s father had a significant influence on Kafka\\'s writing.  [19]   ,  The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz\\'s room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli\\'s former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.  [20]   ,  From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the   Deutsche Knabenschule   German boys\\' elementary school at the   Masný trh/Fleischmarkt   (meat market), now known as Masná Street. His Jewish education ended with his  Bar Mitzvah  celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays a year.  [15]    [21]    [22]   ,  After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state  gymnasium ,   Altstädter Deutsches Gymnasium  , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the  Kinský Palace . German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech.  [23]    [24]   He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades.  [25]   Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent.  [1]    [24]   He completed his  Matura  exams in 1901.  [26]   ,  Admitted to the    Deutsche Karl-Ferdinands-Universität    of Prague in 1901, Kafka began studying chemistry, but switched to law after two weeks.  [27]   Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history.  [28]   He also joined a student club,   Lese- und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten   (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organized literary events, readings and other activities.  [29]   Among Kafka\\'s friends were the journalist  Felix Weltsch , who studied philosophy, the actor  Yitzchak Lowy  who came from an orthodox  Hasidic  Warsaw family, and the writers  Oskar Baum  and  Franz Werfel .  [30]   ,  At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met  Max Brod , a fellow law student who became a close friend for life.  [29]   Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound.  [31]   Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life;  [32]   together he and Brod read Plato\\'s   Protagoras   in the original  Greek , on Brod\\'s initiative, and  Flaubert \\'s    L\\'éducation sentimentale    and    La Tentation de St. Antoine    ( The Temptation of Saint Anthony ) in French, at his own suggestion.  [33]   Kafka considered  Fyodor Dostoyevsky , Flaubert,  Nikolai Gogol ,  Franz Grillparzer ,  [34]   and  Heinrich von Kleist  to be his \"true  blood brothers \".  [35]   Besides these, he took an interest in  Czech literature   [23]    [24]   and was also very fond of the works of  Goethe .  [36]    [37]   Kafka was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906  [b]   and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.  [5]   ,  On 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the    Assicurazioni Generali   , an Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00  [40]    [41]  —making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the  Worker\\'s Accident Insurance Institute  for the  Kingdom of Bohemia . The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for  personal injury  to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor  work safety  policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with  machine   lathes ,  drills ,  planing machines  and  rotary saws  which were rarely fitted with safety guards. ,  The management professor  Peter Drucker  credits Kafka with developing the first civilian  hard hat  while employed at the Worker\\'s Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer.  [42]    [43]   His father often referred to his son\\'s job as an insurance officer as a   Brotberuf  , literally \"bread job\", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums.  [44]   He would compile and compose the  annual report  on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors.  [45]   Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed.  [46]   Kafka\\'s father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store.  [47]   In his later years, Kafka\\'s illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term   Der enge Prager Kreis   (\"The Close Prague Circle\") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.  [48]    [49]   ,  In late 1911, Elli\\'s husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first  asbestos  factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann &amp; Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time.  [50]   During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of  Yiddish theatre . After seeing a Yiddish theater troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka \"immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature\".  [51]   This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism.  [52]   It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian.  [53]   Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World War \\xa0 I, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with  tuberculosis ,  [54]   with which he was diagnosed in 1917.  [55]   In 1918 the Worker\\'s Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in  sanatoriums .  [5]   ,  Kafka was never married. According to Brod, Kafka was \"tortured\" by sexual desire  [56]   and Kafka\\'s biographer  Reiner Stach  states that his life was full of \"incessant womanising\" and that he was filled with a fear of \"sexual failure\".  [57]   He visited brothels for most of his adult life  [58]    [59]    [60]   and was interested in pornography.  [56]   In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met  Felice Bauer , a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a  dictaphone  company. A week after the meeting at Brod\\'s home, Kafka wrote in his diary: ,  Miss FB. When I arrived at Brod\\'s on 13 August, she was sitting at the table. I was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at once. Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was. (I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so closely\\xa0...) Almost broken nose. Blonde, somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat I looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an unshakeable opinion.  [61]    [62]   ,  Shortly after this, Kafka wrote the story \"  Das Urteil  \" (\"The Judgment\") in only one night and worked in a productive period on    Der Verschollene    ( The Man Who Disappeared ) and \" Die Verwandlung \" (\"The Metamorphosis\"). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice.  [63]   Kafka\\'s extant letters to her were published as    Briefe an Felice    ( Letters to Felice ); her letters do not survive.  [61]    [64]    [65]   According to biographers Stach and  James Hawes , around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid.  [63]    [66]   Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time Kafka began a draft of the  Letter to His Father , who objected to Julie because of her  Zionist  beliefs. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman.  [67]   While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was shy—especially about his body.  [5]   ,  Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe \"Grete\" Bloch,  [68]   a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka\\'s son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921.  [69]    [70]   However, Kafka\\'s biographer Peter-André Alt claims that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate.  [71]    [72]   Stach states that Bloch had a son, but there is not solid proof and moreover contradictory evidence that Kafka was the father.  [73]   ,  Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the  Bohemian  village of Zürau (Siřem in the  Czech language ), where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Karl Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best time in his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and   Oktavhefte   ( octavo ). From the notes in these books, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on  Zettel , single pieces of paper in no given order. They were later published as    Die Zürauer Aphorismen  oder Betrachtungen über Sünde, Hoffnung, Leid und den wahren Weg   (The Zürau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).  [74]   ,  In 1920 Kafka began an intense relationship with  Milena Jesenská , a Czech journalist and writer. His letters to her were later published as    Letters to Milena   .  [75]   During a vacation in July 1923 to  Graal-Müritz  on the  Baltic Sea , Kafka met  Dora Diamant , a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and caused him to become interested in the  Talmud .  [76]   He worked on four stories, which he prepared to be published as    Ein Hungerkünstler    ( A Hunger Artist ).  [75]   ,  Kafka feared that people would find him mentally and physically repulsive. However, those who met him found him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence, and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance.  [77]    [78]    [79]   Brod compared Kafka to  Heinrich von Kleist , noting that both writers had the ability to describe a situation realistically with precise details.  [80]   Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice.  [81]   According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music.  [82]   Brod felt that two of Kafka\\'s most distinguishing traits were \"absolute truthfulness\" (  absolute Wahrhaftigkeit  ) and \"precise conscientiousness\" (  präzise Gewissenhaftigkeit  ).  [83]    [84]   He explored details, the inconspicuous, in depth and with such love and precision that things surfaced that were unforeseen, seemingly strange, but absolutely true (  nichts als wahr  ).  [85]   ,  Although Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later showed interest in games and physical activity,  [32]   as a good rider, swimmer, and rower.  [83]   On weekends he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself.  [86]   His other interests included  alternative medicine , modern education systems such as  Montessori ,  [83]   and technical novelties such as airplanes and film.  [87]   Writing was important to Kafka; he considered it a \"form of prayer\".  [88]   He was highly sensitive to noise and preferred quiet when writing.  [89]   ,  Pérez-Álvarez has claimed that Kafka may have possessed a  schizoid personality disorder .  [90]   His style, it is claimed, not only in \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"The Metamorphosis\"), but in various other writings, appears to show low to medium-level schizoid traits, which explain much of his work.  [91]   His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:  [92]   ,  The tremendous world I have in my head. But how to free myself and free them without ripping apart. And a thousand times rather tear in me they hold back or buried. For this I\\'m here, that\\'s quite clear to me.  [93]   ,  and in Zürau Aphorism number 50: ,  Man cannot live without a permanent trust in something indestructible within himself, though both that indestructible something and his own trust in it may remain permanently concealed from him.  [94]   ,  Though Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends.  [95]   He may have suffered from an eating disorder. Doctor Manfred M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic,  University of Munich , presented \"evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical  anorexia nervosa \",  [96]   and that Kafka was not just lonely and depressed but also \"occasionally suicidal\".  [78]   In his 1995 book  Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient ,  Sander Gilman  investigated \"why a Jew might have been considered \\' hypochondriac \\' or \\'homosexual\\' and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing\".  [97]   Kafka considered committing suicide at least once, in late 1912.  [98]   ,  Prior to World War\\xa0I,  [99]   Kafka attended several meetings of the Klub Mladých, a Czech anarchist,  anti-militarist , and  anti-clerical  organization.  [100]    Hugo Bergmann , who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900–1901) because \"[Kafka\\'s] socialism and my  Zionism  were much too strident\".  [101]    [102]   \"Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist\".  [102]   Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for socialism.  [102]   In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to the influential anarchist philosopher  Peter Kropotkin : \"Don\\'t forget Kropotkin!\"  [103]   ,  During the communist era, the legacy of Kafka\\'s work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling  Austria-Hungarian Empire , to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism.  [104]   A further key point was  Marx\\'s theory of alienation . While the orthodox position was that Kafka\\'s depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in  Liblice , Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka\\'s portrayal of bureaucracy.  [105]   Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.  [106]   ,  Kafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew.  [107]   He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to  Yiddish writers .  [108]   Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: \"What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe\".  [109]   In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an atheist.  [110]   ,  Hawes suggests that Kafka, though very aware of his own  Jewishness , did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes.  [111]    [112]    [113]   In the opinion of literary critic  Harold Bloom , although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer.  [114]   Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: \"The presence of Jewishness in Kafka\\'s   oeuvre   is no longer subject to doubt\".  [115]    Pavel Eisner , one of Kafka\\'s first translators, interprets   Der Process   ( The Trial ) as the embodiment of the \"triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague \\xa0 ... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the \\'guiltless guilt\\' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew\".  [116]   ,  In his essay  Sadness in Palestine?! ,  Dan Miron  explores Kafka\\'s connection to Zionism: \"It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles\".  [108]   Kafka considered moving to  Palestine  with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied  Hebrew  while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod\\'s from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him  [108]   and attending Rabbi Julius Grünthal\\'s  [117]   and Rabbi  Julius Guttmann \\'s classes in the Berlin    Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums    (College for the Study of Judaism).  [118]   ,  Livia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the \"symbolic figure of his era\".  [116]   His contemporaries included numerous Jewish, Czech, and German writers who were sensitive to Jewish, Czech, and German culture. According to Rothkirchen, \"This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka\".  [116]   ,  Towards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergman in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine. Bergman refused to host Kafka because he had young children and was afraid that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.  [119]   ,  Kafka\\'s  laryngeal   tuberculosis  worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague,  [63]   where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann\\'s sanatorium in  Kierling  just outside  Vienna  for treatment on 10 April,  [75]   and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka\\'s throat made eating too painful for him, and since  parenteral nutrition  had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him.  [120]    [121]   Kafka was editing \"A Hunger Artist\" on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment.  [122]   His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the  New Jewish Cemetery  in  Prague-Žižkov .  [59]   Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He became famous soon after his death.  [88]   The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect  Leopold Ehrmann .  [123]   ,  All of Kafka\\'s published works, except some letters he wrote in Czech to Milena Jesenská, were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention. ,  Kafka finished none of his full-length novels and burned around 90 percent of his work,  [124]    [125]   much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts.  [126]   In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described in a letter to Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than his own family.  [127]   ,  Kafka\\'s earliest published works were eight stories which appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal   Hyperion   under the title    Betrachtung    ( Contemplation ). He wrote the story \"  Beschreibung eines Kampfes  \" (\"Description of a Struggle\")  [c]   in 1904; he showed it to Brod in 1905 who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to  Hyperion . Kafka published a fragment in 1908  [128]   and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.  [129]   ,  In a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story \"Das Urteil\" (\"The Judgment\", literally: \"The Verdict\") and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fiancée, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer.  [130]   The story is often considered Kafka\\'s breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son\\'s engagement.  [131]    [132]   Kafka later described writing it as \"a complete opening of body and soul\",  [133]   a story that \"evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime\".  [134]   The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated \"to Miss Felice Bauer\", and in subsequent editions \"for F.\"  [75]   ,  In 1912, Kafka wrote \"Die Verwandlung\" (\" The Metamorphosis \", or \"The Transformation\"),  [135]   published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a travelling salesman waking to find himself transformed into a   ungeheures Ungeziefer  , a monstrous  vermin ,   Ungeziefer   being a general term for unwanted and unclean animals. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century.  [136]    [137]    [138]   The story \" In der Strafkolonie \" (\"In the Penal Colony\"), dealing with an elaborate  torture  and execution device, was written in October 1914,  [75]   revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story \" Ein Hungerkünstler \" (\"A Hunger Artist\"), published in the periodical    Die neue Rundschau    in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of  starving himself for extended periods .  [139]   His last story, \" Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse \" (\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\"), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.  [140]   ,  He began his first novel in 1912;  [141]   its first chapter is the story \" Der Heizer \" (\"The Stoker\"). Kafka called the work, which remained unfinished,   Der Verschollene   ( The Man Who Disappeared  or  The Missing Man ), but when Brod published it after Kafka\\'s death he named it  Amerika .  [142]   The inspiration for the novel was the time spent in the audience of Yiddish theatre the previous year, bringing him to a new awareness of his heritage, which led to the thought that an innate appreciation for one\\'s heritage lives deep within each person.  [143]   More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka\\'s works, the novel shares the  motif  of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations.  [144]   It uses many details of experiences of his relatives who had emigrated to America  [145]   and is the only work for which Kafka considered an optimistic ending.  [146]   ,  During 1914, Kafka began the novel    Der Process    ( The Trial ),  [129]   the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Kafka did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to  Nobel Prize winner  and Kafka scholar  Elias Canetti , Felice is central to the plot of  Der Process  and Kafka said it was \"her story\".  [147]    [148]   Canetti titled his book on Kafka\\'s letters to Felice  Kafka\\'s Other Trial , in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel.  [148]   Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for   The New York Times   that Kafka\\'s letters have the \"earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation—combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardor and delight.\"  [148]   ,  According to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel    Das Schloss    (The Castle), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922.  [129]   The protagonist is the   Landvermesser   (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka\\'s intent was that the castle\\'s authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his \"legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there\".  [149]   Dark and at times  surreal , the novel is focused on  alienation ,  bureaucracy , the seemingly endless frustrations of man\\'s attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unobtainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: \"Like dreams, his texts combine precise \"realistic\" detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness.\"  [150]   ,  Kafka\\'s stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly  Hyperion .  [151]    Franz Blei  published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of \"Beschreibung eines Kampfes\" (\"Description of a Struggle\").  [151]   A fragment of the story \" Die Aeroplane in Brescia \" (\"The Aeroplanes at Brescia\"), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily   Bohemia   on 28 September 1909.  [151]    [152]   On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book    Betrachtung    were published in the Easter edition of  Bohemia .  [151]    [153]   In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher  Kurt Wolff  included \" Das Urteil. Eine Geschichte von Franz Kafka. \" (\"The Judgment. A Story by Franz Kafka.\") in their literary yearbook for the art poetry  Arkadia . The story \"  Vor dem Gesetz  \" (\"Before the Law\") was published in the 1915 New Year\\'s edition of the independent Jewish weekly   Selbstwehr  ; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection    Ein Landarzt    ( A Country Doctor ) and became part of the novel   Der Process  . Other stories were published in various publications, including  Martin Buber \\'s   Der Jude  , the paper    Prager Tagblatt   , and the periodicals    Die neue Rundschau   ,   Genius  , and   Prager Presse  .  [151]   ,  Kafka\\'s first published book,   Betrachtung   ( Contemplation , or  Meditation ), was a collection of 18 \\xa0 stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to  Weimar , Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff;  [154]   Wolff published   Betrachtung   in the   Rowohlt Verlag   at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913).  [155]   Kafka dedicated it to Brod, \" Für M.B. \", and added in the personal copy given to his friend \" So wie es hier schon gedruckt ist, für meinen liebsten Max\\u200d—\\u200cFranz K. \" (\"As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max\").  [156]   ,  Kafka\\'s story \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"The Metamorphosis\") was first printed in the October 1915 issue of    Die Weißen Blätter   , a monthly edition of  expressionist  literature, edited by  René Schickele .  [155]   Another story collection,   Ein Landarzt   ( A Country Doctor ), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919,  [155]   dedicated to Kafka\\'s father.  [157]   Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print,   Ein Hungerkünstler    (A Hunger Artist) , which appeared in 1924 after his death, in    Verlag Die Schmiede   . On 20 April 1924, the    Berliner Börsen-Courier    published Kafka\\'s essay on  Adalbert Stifter .  [158]   ,  Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and  literary executor  Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka\\'s death; Kafka wrote: \"Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me \\xa0 ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others\\'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread\".  [159]    [160]   Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939.  [161]   Kafka\\'s last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20 \\xa0 notebooks and 35 \\xa0 letters. These were confiscated by the  Gestapo  in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.  [162]   ,  As Brod published the bulk of the writings in his possession,  [163]   Kafka\\'s work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to arrange Kafka\\'s notebooks in chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end.  [164]    [165]   Brod finished many of Kafka\\'s incomplete works for publication. For example, Kafka left   Der Process   with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and   Das Schloss   with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content;  [165]   Brod rearranged chapters, copy edited the text, and changed the punctuation.   Der Process   appeared in 1925 in   Verlag Die Schmiede  . Kurt Wolff published two other novels,   Das Schloss   in 1926 and  Amerika  in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as    Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer     (The Great Wall of China) , including the  story of the same name . The book appeared in the    Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlag   . Brod\\'s sets are usually called the \"Definitive Editions\".  [166]   ,  In 1961,  Malcolm Pasley  acquired most of Kafka\\'s original handwritten work for the  Oxford   Bodleian Library .  [167]    [168]   The text for   Der Process   was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in  Marbach am Neckar , Germany.  [168]    [169]   Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including  Gerhard Neumann , Jost Schillemeit and Jürgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels;   S. Fischer Verlag   republished them.  [170]   Pasley was the editor for   Das Schloss  , published in 1982, and   Der Process (The Trial)  , published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of   Der Verschollene    ( Amerika )  published in 1983. These are called the \"Critical Editions\" or the \"Fischer Editions\".  [171]   ,  When Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka\\'s unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary  Esther Hoffe .  [172]   She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the  National Library of Israel , which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to  British Palestine  in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of   Der Process   for US$2\\xa0million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive  Museum of Modern Literature  in Marbach am Neckar.  [124]    [173]   Only Eva was still alive as of 2012.  [174]   A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued.  [175]   The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library argues they are \"cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people\".  [175]   The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012 that the papers were the property of the National Library.  [176]   ,  The poet  W. H. Auden  called Kafka \"the  Dante  of the twentieth century\";  [177]   the novelist  Vladimir Nabokov  placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century.  [178]    Gabriel García Márquez  noted the reading of Kafka\\'s \"The Metamorphosis\" showed him \"that it was possible to write in a different way\".  [109]    [179]   A prominent theme of Kafka\\'s work, first established in the short story \"Das Urteil\",  [180]   is father–son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement.  [17]    [180]   Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.  [181]   ,  Kafka\\'s style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of \"Die Verwandlung\" and \"Der Heizer\" by Oscar Walzel in  Berliner Beiträge .  [182]   The nature of Kafka\\'s prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools.  [106]    Marxists , for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka\\'s works.  [100]    [106]   Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism.  [106]   The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of  existentialism .  [183]   Some of Kafka\\'s books are influenced by the  expressionist  movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental  modernist  genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burroughs claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships.  [184]   Others, such as  Thomas Mann , see Kafka\\'s work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.  [185]    [186]   ,  According to  Gilles Deleuze  and  Félix Guattari , the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka\\'s work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka\\'s work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading his work while focusing on the futility of his characters\\' struggles reveals Kafka\\'s play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds.  [187]    [188]   Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer  Milan Kundera  suggests that Kafka\\'s  surrealist humour  may have been an inversion of Dostoyevsky\\'s presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka\\'s work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka\\'s inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.  [189]   ,  Attempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka\\'s legal background and the role of law in his fiction.  [190]    [191]   Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work,  [192]   in which the legal system is often oppressive.  [193]   The law in Kafka\\'s works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control.  [192]   Critics who support this  absurdist  interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary: ,  Enclosed in my own four walls, I found myself as an immigrant imprisoned in a foreign country;... I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites, and very language defied comprehension;... though I did not want it, they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals;... I could not resist.  [194]   ,  However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka\\'s descriptions of the legal proceedings in   Der Process  —metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear—are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were  inquisitorial  rather than  adversarial .  [195]   Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was \"keenly aware of the legal debates of his day\".  [191]    [196]   In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka\\'s office writings as its point of departure,  [197]   Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law \"has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination\".  [198]   ,  The earliest English translations of Kafka\\'s works were by  Edwin and Willa Muir , who in 1930 translated the first German edition of   Das Schloss  . This was published as  The Castle  by  Secker &amp; Warburg  in England and  Alfred A. Knopf  in the United States.  [199]   A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka\\'s popularity in the United States during the late 1940s.  [200]   The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by  Schocken Books  in 1948 as   The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces  ,  [201]   including additionally   The First Long Train Journey  , written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka\\'s \"A Novel about Youth\", a review of Felix Sternheim\\'s  Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald , his essay on Kleist\\'s \"Anecdotes\", his review of the literary magazine   Hyperion  , and an epilogue by Brod. ,  Later editions, notably those of 1954 (  Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings  ), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and  Ernst Kaiser ,  [202]   which had been deleted by earlier publishers.  [170]   Known as \"Definitive Editions\", they include translations of  The Trial, Definitive ,   The Castle, Definitive  , and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation.  [203]   Published in 1961 by Schocken Books,   Parables and Paradoxes   presented in a bilingual edition by  Nahum N. Glatzer  selected writings,  [204]   drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel  Der Process . ,  New translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit\\u200d—\\u200c  The Castle, Critical   by  Mark Harman  ( Schocken Books , 1998),  [168]    The Trial, Critical  by  Breon Mitchell  (Schocken Books, 1998),  [205]   and  Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared  by  Michael Hofmann  ( New Directions Publishing , 2004).  [206]   ,  Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka\\'s sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—this being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is due to the construction of  subordinate clauses in German  which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text.  [207]   German\\'s more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English.  [208]   An example is the first sentence of Kafka\\'s \"The Metamorphosis\", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:  [209]   ,    Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt  . (original) ,  As Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word-for-word translation)  [210]   ,  Another difficult problem facing translators is how to deal with the author\\'s intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely.  [211]    [212]   One such instance is found in the first sentence of  \"The Metamorphosis\" . English translators often render the word   Ungeziefer   as \"insect\"; in Middle German, however,   Ungeziefer   literally means \"an animal unclean for sacrifice\";  [213]   in today\\'s German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean \"bug\"\\xa0—a very general term, unlike the scientific \"insect\". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor\\'s disgust at his transformation.  [136]    [137]   Another example is Kafka\\'s use of the German noun    Verkehr    in the final sentence of \"Das Urteil\". Literally,   Verkehr   means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: \"At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge\".  [214]   The double meaning of  Verkehr  is given added weight by Kafka\\'s confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of \"a violent ejaculation\".  [134]    [215]   ,  Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective.  [216]   Shimon Sandbank, a professor, literary critic, and writer, identifies Kafka as having influenced  Jorge Luis Borges ,  Albert Camus ,  Eugène Ionesco ,  J. M. Coetzee  and  Jean-Paul Sartre .  [217]   A  Financial Times  literary critic credits Kafka with influencing  José Saramago ,  [218]   and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that  J. D. Salinger  loved to read Kafka\\'s works.  [219]   In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked   Der Process   and   Das Schloss   the second and ninth  most significant German-language novels of the 20th century .  [220]   Sandbank argues that despite Kafka\\'s pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated.  [217]   Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at  Binghamton University  who specialises in Kafka\\'s works, says Kafka\\'s influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture.  [221]   Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka \"has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century\".  [5]   Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the \"century of Kafka\".  [5]   ,  Michel-André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the \"irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world\".  [181]   His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka\\'s universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as  George Orwell  and  Ray Bradbury .  [181]   ,  The following are examples of works across a range of literary, musical, and dramatic genres which demonstrate the extent of cultural influence: ,  The term \"Kafkaesque\" is used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work, particularly   Der Process   (  The Trial  ) and \"Die Verwandlung\" (  The Metamorphosis  ). Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.  [5]    [223]    [240]    [241]   ,  Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction. Works in this genre that have been thus described include  Patrick Bokanowski \\'s 1982 film   The Angel  , Terry Gilliam\\'s 1985 film   Brazil  , and the 1998 science fiction  film noir ,   Dark City  . Films from other genres which have been similarly described include   The Tenant   (1976) and   Barton Fink   (1991).  [242]   The television series   The Prisoner   and   The Twilight Zone   are also frequently described as Kafkaesque.  [243]    [244]   ,  However, with common usage, the term has become so ubiquitous that Kafka scholars note it\\'s often misused.  [245]   More accurately then, according to author Ben Marcus, paraphrased in \"What it Means to be Kafkaesque\" by Joe Fassler in  The Atlantic , \"Kafka’s quintessential qualities are affecting use of language, a setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness—hopelessly and full of hope.\"   [246]   ,  The  Franz Kafka Museum  in Prague is dedicated to Kafka and his work. A major component of the museum is an exhibit  The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague , which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the  Jewish Museum  in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in  Malá Strana  (Lesser Town), along the  Moldau . The museum calls its display of original photos and documents  Město K. Franz Kafka a Praha  (City K. Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote.  [247]   ,  The  Franz Kafka Prize  is an annual literary award of the  Franz Kafka Society  and the City of Prague established in 2001. It recognizes the merits of literature as \"humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times\".  [248]   The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language.  [248]   The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in  Prague\\'s Old Town Hall  on the Czech State Holiday in late October.  [248]   ,   San Diego State University  (SDSU) operates the   Kafka Project  , which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka\\'s last writings.

       " '[  First World War  ,   John Ronald Reuel Tolkien ,   CBE ,  FRSL   (   /  ˈ  t  ɒ  l  k  iː  n  /   ;  [a]   3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet,  philologist , and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic  high-fantasy  works   The Hobbit  ,   The Lord of the Rings  , and   The Silmarillion  . ,  He served as the  Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon  and Fellow of  Pembroke College, Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and  Merton Professor of English Language and Literature  and Fellow of  Merton College, Oxford  from 1945 to 1959.  [1]   He was at one time a close friend of  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis —they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the  Inklings . Tolkien was appointed a  Commander of the Order of the British Empire  by Queen  Elizabeth II  on 28 March 1972. ,  After Tolkien\\'s death, his son  Christopher  published a series of works based on his father\\'s extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including  The Silmarillion . These, together with  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings , form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called  Arda  and  Middle-earth   [b]   within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term   legendarium   to the larger part of these writings.  [2]   ,  While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien,  [3]   the great success of  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  led directly to  a popular resurgence of the genre . This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature  [4]    [5]  —or, more precisely, of high fantasy.  [6]   In 2008,   The Times   ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".  [7]     Forbes   ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009.  [8]   ,  Tolkien\\'s paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family had emigrated from Germany in the 18th century but had become \"quickly intensely English\".  [9]   According to the family tradition, the Tolkiens had arrived in England in 1756, as refugees from  Frederick the Great \\'s invasion of the  Electorate of Saxony  during the  Seven Years\\' War .  [10]   Several families with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling live in northwestern Germany, mainly in Lower Saxony and Hamburg.  [11]    [12]   ,  Tolkien believed his surname derived from the German word  tollkühn , meaning \"foolhardy\",  [13]   and jokingly inserted himself as a \"cameo\" into   The Notion Club Papers   under the literally-translated name Rashbold. However, this origin of the name has not been proven.  [14]   A German writer has suggested that the name is more likely to derive from the village of  Tolkynen  near  Rastenburg ,  East Prussia  (now in Poland and known as Tołkiny). Although that village is far from Lower Saxony, its name is derived from the now-extinct  Old Prussian language .  [15]    [16]   ,  John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in  Bloemfontein  in the  Orange Free State  (now  Free State Province  in South Africa) to  Arthur Reuel Tolkien  (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel,  née  Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother,  Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien , who was born on 17 February 1894.  [17]   ,  As a child, he was bitten by a large  baboon spider  in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although Tolkien admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his  kraal  to show him off, returning him the next morning.  [18]   ,  When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of  rheumatic fever  before he could join them.  [19]   This left the family without an income, so Tolkien\\'s mother took him to live with her parents in  Kings Heath ,  [20]   Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to  Sarehole  (now in  Hall Green ), then a  Worcestershire  village, later annexed to Birmingham.  [21]   He enjoyed exploring  Sarehole Mill  and  Moseley Bog  and the  Clent ,  Lickey  and  Malvern Hills , which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as  Bromsgrove ,  Alcester , and  Alvechurch  and places such as his aunt Jane\\'s farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.  [22]   ,  Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.  [23]   She taught him a great deal of  botany  and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of  Latin  very early.  [24]   ,  Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked   Treasure Island   and   The Pied Piper   and thought   Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland   by  Lewis Carroll  was \"amusing but disturbing\". He liked stories about  \"Red Indians\"  (Native Americans) and the fantasy works by  George MacDonald .  [25]   In addition, the \"Fairy Books\" of  Andrew Lang  were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.  [26]   ,  Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,  [28]   which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of  acute diabetes  at Fern Cottage in  Rednal , which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with  diabetes mellitus type 1  could live without treatment— insulin  would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, \"My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.\"  [28]   ,  Prior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the  Birmingham Oratory , who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called \"Father Francis\": \"He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was  not . I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the \\'liberal\\' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [i.e. Tolkien having grown up knowing more] about \\' Bloody Mary \\' than the  Mother of Jesus —who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists.\"  [29]   ,  After his mother\\'s death, Tolkien grew up in the  Edgbaston  area of Birmingham and attended  King Edward\\'s School, Birmingham , and later  St. Philip\\'s School . In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward\\'s. While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school\\'s  Officers Training Corps  who helped \"line the route\" for the 1910  coronation  parade of King  George V . Like the other cadets from King Edward\\'s, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of  Buckingham Palace .  [30]   ,  In Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of  Perrott\\'s Folly  and the  Victorian  tower of  Edgbaston Waterworks , which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.  [31]    [32]   Another strong influence was the  romantic  medievalist paintings of  Edward Burne-Jones  and the  Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ; the  Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery  had a large collection of works on public display.  [33]   ,  While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a  constructed language , Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.  [34]    [35]   ,  Tolkien learned  Esperanto  some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears.  [36]   Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto.  [37]   ,  In 1911, while they were at King Edward\\'s School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow\\'s Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.  [38]    [39]   After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a \"council\" in London at Wiseman\\'s home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry. ,  In 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,  [30]   noting that  Bilbo \\'s journey across the  Misty Mountains  (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from  Interlaken  to  Lauterbrunnen  and on to camp in the  moraines  beyond  Mürren . Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of  Jungfrau  and  Silberhorn  (\"the Silvertine ( Celebdil ) of my dreams\"). They went across the  Kleine Scheidegg  to  Grindelwald  and on across the  Grosse Scheidegg  to  Meiringen . They continued across the  Grimsel Pass , through the upper  Valais  to  Brig  and on to the  Aletsch glacier  and  Zermatt .  [40]   ,  In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at  Exeter College, Oxford . He initially studied  Classics  but changed his course in 1913 to English Language and  Literature , graduating in 1915 with  first-class honours  in his final examinations.  [41]   ,  At the age of 16, J.R.R. Tolkien met  Edith Mary Bratt , who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road,  Edgbaston . According to Humphrey Carpenter, ,  Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.  [42]   ,  His guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien\\'s having \"muffed\" his exams and considered it \"altogether unfortunate\"  [43]   that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older,  Protestant  woman. He prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter,  [44]   with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.  [45]   ,  In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: ,  I had to choose between disobeying and grieving (or deceiving) a guardian who had been a father to me, more than most fathers ... and \"dropping\" the love-affair until I was 21. I don\\'t regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly  three  years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.  [43]   ,  On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at  Cheltenham . He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien\\'s letter, everything had changed. ,  On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien\\'s proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".  [46]   Upon learning of Edith\\'s new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"  [47]   ,  Following their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien\\'s insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly  anti-Catholic \", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.  [48]   ,  Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at  St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick , on 22 March 1916.  [49]   In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife\\'s willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.  [43]   ,  In August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the  First World War . Tolkien\\'s relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the  British Army . In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"  [43]   ,  Instead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",  [43]   and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".  [43]   He was then commissioned as a temporary  second lieutenant  in the  Lancashire Fusiliers  on 15 July 1915.  [50]    [51]   He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on  Cannock Chase ,  Staffordshire , for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"  [52]   Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp. ,  On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to  Folkestone  for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough &amp; Harrow Hotel in Birmingham. ,  He later wrote, \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then\\xa0... it was like a death.\"  [53]   ,  On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to  Calais . Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the  British Expeditionary Force \\'s (BEF) base depot at  Étaples . On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the  74th Brigade ,  25th Division . ,  While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled,  The Lonely Isle , which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army\\'s  postal censorship , he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.  [54]   ,  He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at  Rubempré , near  Amiens .  [55]   He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.  [56]   According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol forbade him from developing friendships with \" other ranks \". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"  [57]   ,  Tolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"  [57]   ,  Tolkien arrived at the  Somme  in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at  Bouzincourt , he participated in the assaults on the  Schwaben Redoubt  and the  Leipzig Salient . According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers,  Anglican  chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers: ,  On one occasion I spent the night with the Brigade Machine Gun Officer and the Signals Officer in one of the captured German dugouts ... We dossed down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep, but it was not to be. We no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up. So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of   hors d\\'oeuvre   and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.  [58]   ,  Tolkien\\'s time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband\\'s death. To get around the  British Army \\'s  postal censorship , the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband\\'s movements on a map of the  Western Front . ,  On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked  Regina Trench , Tolkien came down with  trench fever , a disease carried by  lice , which were common in the dugouts. Tolkien was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.  [59]   Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the  first day of the Somme  while leading his men in the assault on  Beaumont Hamel . Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien\\'s battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England. ,  Tolkien might well have been killed himself, but he had suffered from health problems and had been removed from combat multiple times.  [60]   ,  According to John Garth: ,  Although  Kitchener \\'s  army  enshrined old social boundaries, it also chipped away at the class divide by throwing men from all walks of life into a desperate situation together. Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, \\'a deep sympathy and feeling for the  Tommy ; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties\\'. He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.  [61]   ,  In later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the  Second World War  were entirely mistaken: ,  One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.  [62]   ,  A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.  [63]    [64]   ,  During his recovery in a cottage in  Little Haywood ,  Staffordshire , he began to work on what he called   The Book of Lost Tales  , beginning with   The Fall of Gondolin  .  Lost Tales  represented Tolkien\\'s attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing.  [65]   Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great  U-Boat campaign ) round about the  Battle of Cambrai , when then end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\".  [43]   ,  Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918.  [66]   When he was stationed at  Kingston upon Hull , he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby  Roos , and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife\\'s death in 1971, Tolkien remembered, ,  I never called Edith  Luthien —but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the  Silmarillion . It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks  [67]   at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing—and  dance . But the story has gone crooked, &amp; I am left, and  I  cannot plead before the inexorable  Mandos .  [68]   ,  This incident inspired the account of the meeting of  Beren and Lúthien .  [69]   ,  On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.  [70]   His first civilian job after World War I was at the   Oxford English Dictionary  , where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter  W .  [71]   In 1920, he took up a post as  Reader  in English Language at the  University of Leeds , and became the youngest professor there.  [72]   While at Leeds, he produced  A Middle English Vocabulary  and a definitive edition of   Sir Gawain and the Green Knight   with  E. V. Gordon , both becoming academic standard works for several decades. He also translated  Sir Gawain ,   Pearl  , and   Sir Orfeo  . In 1925, he returned to Oxford as  Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon , with a fellowship at  Pembroke College . ,  During his time at  Pembroke College  Tolkien wrote   The Hobbit   and the first two volumes of  The Lord of the Rings , whilst living at 20  Northmoor Road  in  North Oxford  (where a  blue plaque  was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name \" Nodens \", following Sir  Mortimer Wheeler \\'s unearthing of a  Roman   Asclepeion  at  Lydney Park , Gloucestershire, in 1928.  [73]   ,  In the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of   Beowulf  , which he finished in 1926. He never published it. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than forty years after Tolkien\\'s death and almost 90 years since its completion.  [74]   ,  Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, entitled \" Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics \", which had a lasting influence on  Beowulf  research.  [75]   Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about  Beowulf  is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.  [76]   At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated  Beowulf  for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of  Beowulf  was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.  [77]   Where  Beowulf  does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at  Finnsburg , Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.  [78]   In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: \"Beowulf is among my most valued sources\", and this influence may be seen throughout his  Middle-earth   legendarium .  [79]   ,  According to  Humphrey Carpenter , Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on  Beowulf : ,  He would come silently into the room, fix the audience with his gaze, and suddenly begin to declaim in a resounding voice the opening lines of the poem in the original Anglo-Saxon, commencing with a great cry of   Hwæt !  (The first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be \"Quiet!\" It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that  Beowulf  was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry.  [80]   ,  Decades later,  W.H. Auden  wrote to his former professor, ,  I don\\'t think that I have ever told you what an unforgettable experience it was for me as an undergraduate, hearing you recite  Beowulf . The voice was the voice of  Gandalf .  [80]   ,  In the run-up to the  Second World War , Tolkien was earmarked as a  codebreaker .  [81]    [82]   In January 1939, he was asked whether he would be prepared to serve in the  cryptographic  department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency.  [81]    [82]   He replied in the affirmative and, beginning on 27 March, took an instructional course at the London HQ of the  Government Code and Cypher School .  [81]    [82]   A record of his training was found which included the notation \"keen\" next to his name,  [83]   although Tolkien scholar Anders Stenström suggested that \"In all likelihood, that is not a record of Tolkien\\'s interest, but a note about how to pronounce the name.\"  [84]   He was informed in October that his services would not be required.  [81]    [82]   ,  In 1945, Tolkien moved to  Merton College, Oxford , becoming the  Merton Professor of English Language and Literature ,  [85]   in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for  University College, Dublin , for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the  National University of Ireland  (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed  The Lord of the Rings  in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches. ,  Tolkien also translated the  Book of Jonah  for the   Jerusalem Bible  , which was published in 1966.  [86]   ,  The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984),  Christopher John Reuel Tolkien  (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated  letters from Father Christmas  when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas\\'s helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas\\'s battles against  goblins  who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.  [87]   ,  During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend  C. S. Lewis  even nominated him for the  Nobel Prize in Literature .  [88]   The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.  [24]   At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers\\' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement.  [89]   In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a  cult-figure , but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\"  [90]   ,  Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,  [91]   and eventually he and Edith moved to  Bournemouth , which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien\\'s status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow  Inklings . Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place. ,  According to  Humphrey Carpenter : ,  Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other\\'s health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other\\'s birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage. They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.  [92]   ,  Edith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. According to  Simon Tolkien : ,  My grandmother died two years before my grandfather and he came back to live in Oxford.  Merton College  gave him rooms just off the High Street. I went there frequently and he\\'d take me to lunch in the Eastgate Hotel. Those lunches were rather wonderful for a 12-year-old boy spending time with his grandfather, but sometimes he seemed sad. There was one visit when he told me how much he missed my grandmother. It must have been very strange for him being alone after they had been married for more than 50 years.  [93]   ,  Tolkien was appointed by  Queen Elizabeth II  a Commander of the  Order of the British Empire  in the  1972 New Year Honours   [94]   and received the insignia of the Order at  Buckingham Palace  on 28 March 1972.  [95]   In the same year Oxford University conferred upon him an honorary  Doctorate of Letters .  [41]    [96]   ,  Tolkien had the name  Lúthien  engraved on Edith\\'s tombstone at  Wolvercote Cemetery ,  Oxford . When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973, at the age of 81,  [97]   he was buried in the same grave, with  Beren  added to his name. The engravings read: ,  In Tolkien\\'s  Middle-earth   legendarium , Lúthien was the most beautiful of all the  Children of Ilúvatar , and forsook her  immortality  for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the  Dark Lord   Morgoth , Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking  wolfhound   Huan . Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf  Carcharoth , Lúthien, like  Orpheus , approached the  Valar , the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life. ,  Tolkien was a devout  Roman Catholic , and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with  libertarian ,  Distributist , and  monarchist  leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, \"My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy ( philosophically understood , meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)—or to \\'unconstitutional\\'  Monarchy .\"  [98]   ,  Although he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the  British Empire  and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d\\'Ardenne, he wrote, \"The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the  Tweed  and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when  Hitler  (or a Frenchman) says \\'Germany (or France) must live forever\\' we know that he lies.\"  [99]   ,  Tolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and  simpler life . For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle.  [100]   This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced \"industrialization\" of the  Shire  in  The Lord of the Rings .  [101]   ,  Many commentators  [102]   have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien\\'s lifetime.  The Lord of the Rings  is often thought to represent England during and immediately after World War \\xa0 II. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.  [102]   This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \" On Fairy-Stories \", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in  The Lord of the Rings . Tolkien objected strongly to C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis\\'s use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.  [103]   However, Tolkien wrote that the  Mount Doom  scene exemplified lines from the  Lord\\'s Prayer .  [104]    [105]   ,  His love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed  mythology  to be the divine echo of \"the Truth\".  [106]   This view was expressed in his poem and essay entitled   Mythopoeia  .  [107]   His theory that myths held \"fundamental truths\" became a central theme of the Inklings in general. ,  Tolkien\\'s devout Roman Catholic faith was a significant factor in the conversion of  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis  from  atheism  to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the  Church of England .  [108]   ,  According to his grandson  Simon Tolkien , Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the  liturgical  reforms and changes implemented after the  Second Vatican Council : ,  I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn\\'t agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.  [93]   ,  Tolkien voiced support for the  Nationalists  (eventually led by  Franco  during the  Spanish Civil War ) upon hearing that communist  Republicans  were destroying churches and  killing priests and nuns .  [109]   ,  Tolkien was contemptuous of  Joseph Stalin . During World War \\xa0 II, Tolkien referred to Stalin as \"that bloodthirsty old murderer\".  [110]   However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that  The Lord of the Rings  was an  anti-communist   parable  and identified  Sauron  with Stalin. Tolkien said, \"I utterly repudiate any such  reading , which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the  Russian revolution . Such  allegory  is entirely foreign to my thought.\"  [111]   ,  Christine Chism  [112]   distinguishes  racist  or  racialist  elements in Tolkien\\'s views and works as falling into three categories: intentional racism,  [113]   unconscious  Eurocentric  bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien\\'s early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies in his late work. ,  Tolkien once wrote of  racial segregation  in South Africa, \"The treatment of colour nearly always horrifies anyone going out from Britain.\"  [114]   ,  Tolkien vocally opposed  Adolf Hitler  and the  Nazi Party  prior to the  Second World War , and was known to especially despise  Nazi  racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening Verlag was preparing to release  The Hobbit  in  Nazi Germany . To Tolkien\\'s outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of  Aryan  origin. In a letter to his British publisher  Stanley Unwin , he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many  Jewish  friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\".  [115]   He provided two letters to Rütten &amp; Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \" Aryan \" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of  Indo-Iranian languages . He continued, ,  But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of  Jewish  origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have  no  ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject—which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.  [116]   ,  In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in \"Nordicism\": ,  You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil. But no one ever calls on me to \"broadcast\" or do a postscript. Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this \"Nordic\" nonsense. Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.  [117]   ,  In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as \" Nordic \", a term he said he disliked because of its association with  racialist theories .  [118]   ,  Tolkien criticized Allied use of  total war  tactics against civilians from  Nazi Germany  and  Imperial Japan . In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote: ,  We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,—you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter—leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.  [119]   ,  He also reacted with anger at the excesses of  anti-German  propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher: ,  ...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don\\'t know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.  [120]   ,  He was horrified by the  atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , referring to the scientists of the  Manhattan Project  as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \" Babel -builders\".  [121]   ,  During most of his own life conservationism wasn\\'t yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of  The Lord of the Rings , Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.  [122]    [123]    [124]   ,  Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his   legendarium  , beginning with   The Book of Lost Tales  , written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during  The Battle of the Somme . The two most prominent stories, the tale of  Beren and Lúthien  and that of  Túrin , were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in   The Lays of Beleriand  ). ,  One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the  Arts and Crafts   polymath   William Morris . Tolkien wished to imitate Morris\\'s prose and poetry romances,  [125]   from which he took hints for the names of features such as the  Dead Marshes  in  The Lord of the Rings   [126]   and  Mirkwood ,  [127]   along with some general aspects of approach. ,   Edward Wyke-Smith \\'s  The Marvellous Land of Snergs , with its \"table-high\" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo\\'s race in  The Hobbit .  [128]   ,  Tolkien also cited  H. Rider Haggard \\'s novel   She   in a telephone interview: \"I suppose as a boy  She  interested me as much as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving.\"  [129]   A supposed facsimile of this  potsherd  appeared in Haggard\\'s first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She\\'s ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the  Testament of  Isildur   in  The Lord of the Rings   [130]   and to Tolkien\\'s efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the   Book of Mazarbul  .  [131]   Critics starting with  Edwin Muir   [132]   have found resemblances between Haggard\\'s romances and Tolkien\\'s.  [133]    [134]    [135]   ,  Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by  S. R. Crockett \\'s historical novel  The Black Douglas  and of basing the Necromancer ( Sauron ) on its villain,  Gilles de Retz .  [136]   Incidents in both  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  are similar in narrative and style to the novel,  [137]   and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien.  [138]   ,  Tolkien was inspired by early  Germanic , especially  Old English , literature,  poetry , and  mythology , which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included  Old English literature  such as   Beowulf  ,  Norse sagas  such as the   Volsunga saga   and the   Hervarar saga  ,  [139]   the   Poetic Edda  , the   Prose Edda  , the   Nibelungenlied  , and numerous other culturally related works.  [140]   Despite the similarities of his work to the  Volsunga saga  and the  Nibelungenlied , which were the basis for  Richard Wagner \\'s opera cycle   Der Ring des Nibelungen  , Tolkien dismissed critics\\' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, \"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\" However, some critics  [141]    [142]    [143]   believe that Tolkien was, in fact, indebted to Wagner for elements such as the \"concept of the Ring as giving the owner mastery of the world ...\"  [144]   Two of the characteristics possessed by the  One Ring , its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills, were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner\\'s opera. ,  Tolkien also acknowledged several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas.  Sophocles \\' play   Oedipus Rex   he cited as inspiring elements of   The Silmarillion   and   The Children of Húrin  . In addition, Tolkien first read  William Forsell Kirby \\'s translation of the Finnish  national epic , the   Kalevala  , while attending King Edward\\'s School. He described its character of  Väinämöinen  as one of his influences for  Gandalf the Grey . The  Kalevala\\' s  antihero   Kullervo  was further described as an inspiration for  Túrin Turambar .  [145]    Dimitra Fimi ,  Douglas A. Anderson , John Garth, and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of  Celtic  ( Irish ,  Scottish  and  Welsh ) history and legends.  [146]    [147]   However, after the  Silmarillion  manuscript was rejected, in part for its \"eye-splitting\" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin: ,  Needless to say they are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason. They have bright colour, but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design. They are in fact \"mad\" as your reader says—but I don\\'t believe I am.  [148]    [149]   ,  Catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien\\'s creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.  [140]    [150]   Tolkien acknowledged this himself: ,   The Lord of the Rings  is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like \\'religion\\', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.  [151]   ,  Specifically,  Paul H. Kocher  argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the  absence of good . He cites many examples in  The Lord of the Rings , such as Sauron\\'s \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien\\'s source as  Thomas Aquinas , \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\".  [152]    Tom Shippey  makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with  Alfred the Great \\'s Anglo-Saxon translation of  Boethius \\'   Consolation of Philosophy  , known as the   Lays of Boethius  . Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of  Frodo \\'s remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by  Treebeard  and  Elrond .  [153]   He goes on to argue that in  The Lord of the Rings  evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the  Manichaean heresy ), and suggests that Alfred\\'s additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.  [154]   ,  Another interesting argument is Stratford Caldecott\\'s theological view on the Ring and what it represents. \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly \"thin\" and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run\".  [155]   ,  As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic   Beowulf   by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day.  Beowulf  is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien\\'s later fiction, with major details of both  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of  Beowulf  which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem: ,  As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.  [156]   ,  In addition to his  mythopoeic  compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.  [157]   He wrote annual Christmas letters from  Father Christmas  for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as   The Father Christmas Letters  ). Other stories included   Mr. Bliss   and   Roverandom   (for children), and   Leaf by Niggle   (part of   Tree and Leaf  ),   The Adventures of Tom Bombadil  ,   On Fairy-Stories  ,   Smith of Wootton Major   and   Farmer Giles of Ham  .  Roverandom  and  Smith of Wootton Major , like  The Hobbit , borrowed ideas from his  legendarium . ,  Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called   The Hobbit  , which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm  George Allen &amp; Unwin , who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.  [97]   However, when it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel. ,  The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel   The Lord of the Rings   (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for  The Lord of the Rings , during which time he received the constant support of the  Inklings , in particular his closest friend  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis , the author of   The Chronicles of Narnia  . Both  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  are set against the background of  The Silmarillion , but in a time long after it. ,  Tolkien at first intended  The Lord of the Rings  to be a children\\'s tale in the style of  The Hobbit , but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.  [158]   Though a direct sequel to  The Hobbit , it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense  backstory  of  Beleriand  that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in  The Silmarillion  and other volumes. Tolkien\\'s influence weighs heavily on the  fantasy  genre that grew up after the success of  The Lord of the Rings . ,   The Lord of the Rings  became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.  [159]   In the 2003 \" Big Read \" survey conducted by the BBC,  The Lord of the Rings  was found to be the UK\\'s \"Best-loved Novel\".  [160]   Australians voted  The Lord of the Rings  \"My Favourite Book\" in a 2004 survey conducted by the  Australian ABC .  [161]   In a 1999 poll of  Amazon.com  customers,  The Lord of the Rings  was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\".  [162]   In 2002 Tolkien was voted the 92nd \" greatest Briton \" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 he was voted 35th in the  SABC3\\'s Great South Africans , the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is not limited to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK\\'s \"Big Read\" survey, about 250,000 Germans found  The Lord of the Rings  to be their favourite work of literature.  [163]   ,  Tolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the   Quenta Silmarillion  , an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with  The Lord of the Rings , but publishers (both  Allen &amp; Unwin  and  Collins ) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring  The Lord of the Rings  to be published in three volumes.  [164]   The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series   The History of Middle-earth  , edited by Tolkien\\'s son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of  The Fall of  Númenor  , which was inspired by the legend of  Atlantis . ,  Tolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his  literary executor , and he (with assistance from  Guy Gavriel Kay , later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as   The Silmarillion   in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.  [165]   ,  In 1980 Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title   Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth  . In subsequent years (1983–1996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called   The History of Middle-earth  . They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between  The Lord of the Rings  and  The Hobbit , the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing  The Hobbit  for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.  [166]   ,  One of Tolkien\\'s least-known short works is the children\\'s  storybook    Mr. Bliss  , published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien\\'s own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien\\'s sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of  The Hobbit . The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien\\'s difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page. ,  More recently, in 2007,   The Children of Húrin   was published by  HarperCollins  (in the UK and Canada) and  Houghton Mifflin  (in the US). The novel tells the story of  Túrin Turambar  and his sister  Nienor , children of  Húrin Thalion . The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from  The Silmarillion ,   Unfinished Tales  ,   The History of Middle-earth  , and unpublished manuscripts. ,    The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún  , which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of  Sigurd  and the fall of the  Niflungs  from Germanic mythology. It is a  narrative poem  composed in  alliterative verse  and is modelled after the  Old Norse  poetry of the  Elder Edda . Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father\\'s work. ,  According to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work\\'s composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\"  [167]   In a 1967 letter to  W. H. Auden , Tolkien wrote, ,  Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganizing   The Song of the Sibyl  . In return again I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn\\'t lost), a thing I did many years ago when trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the Völsungs from the Elder Edda, written in the old eight-line  fornyrðislag  stanza.  [168]   ,    The Fall of Arthur  , published on 23 May 2013, is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early-1930s. It is  alliterative , extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the  Old English    Beowulf   metre in Modern English. Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman  Migration Period , both in form (using  Germanic verse ) and in content, showing Arthur as a  British   warlord  fighting the  Saxon invasion , while it avoids the high medieval aspects Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the  Saxon lands  ( Arthur eastward in arms purposed ).  [169]   ,    Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary  , published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem   Beowulf   from  Old English  to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher. The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien\\'s acclaimed 1936 lecture \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\".  [170]   The book also includes the previously unpublished \"Sellic Spell\" and two versions of \"The Lay of Beowulf\". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf\\'s biographical background, while the latter is a poem on the Beowulf theme.  [171]   ,    The Story of Kullervo  , first published in   Tolkien Studies   in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015, is a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem. It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford.  [172]   ,    The Tale of Beren and Lúthien   is one of the oldest and most often revised in Tolkien\\'s legendarium. The story is one of three contained within  The Silmarillion  which Tolkien believed to warrant their own long-form narratives. It was published as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, under the title  Beren and Lúthien  in 2017.  [173]   ,  Before his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including  The Lord of the Rings ,  The Hobbit  and  Farmer Giles of Ham —to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at  Marquette University \\'s John P. Raynor, S.J., Library in  Milwaukee , Wisconsin.  [174]   After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien\\'s  Silmarillion  mythology and his academic work to  Oxford University \\'s  Bodleian Library .  [175]   ,  In 2009, a partial draft of   Language and Human Nature  , which Tolkien had begun co-writing with  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis  but had never completed, was discovered at the Bodleian Library.  [176]   ,  Both Tolkien\\'s academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and  philology . He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with  Old Norse  as special subject. He worked for the  Oxford English Dictionary  from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including  walrus , over which he struggled mightily.  [177]   In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the  University of Leeds , where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of  linguistics  from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English  heroic verse ,  history of English , various  Old English  and  Middle English  texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory  Germanic  philology,  Gothic ,  Old Icelandic , and  Medieval Welsh . When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at  Pembroke College, Oxford , he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \" Viking Club \".  [178]   He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.  [179]   ,  Privately, Tolkien was attracted to \"things of  racial  and linguistic significance\", and in his 1955 lecture   English and Welsh  , which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of \"inherent linguistic predilections\", which he termed the \"native language\" as opposed to the \"cradle-tongue\" which a person first learns to speak.  [180]   He considered the  West Midlands  dialect of Middle English to be his own \"native language\", and, as he wrote to  W. H. Auden  in 1955, \"I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).\"  [181]   ,  Parallel to Tolkien\\'s professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for  constructing languages . The most developed of these are  Quenya  and  Sindarin , the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien\\'s  legendarium . Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of  aesthetics  and  euphony , and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.  [149]   A notable addition came in late 1945 with  Adûnaic  or  Númenórean , a language of a \"faintly  Semitic  flavour\", connected with Tolkien\\'s  Atlantis  legend, which by   The Notion Club Papers   ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \" Second Age \" and the story of  Eärendil  was grounded in the  legendarium , thereby providing a link of Tolkien\\'s 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth. ,  Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of  auxiliary languages : in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture   A Secret Vice  , \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \" Volapük ,  Esperanto ,  Ido ,  Novial , &amp;c, &amp;c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".  [182]   ,  The popularity of Tolkien\\'s books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien\\'s idiosyncratic spellings  dwarves  and  dwarvish  (alongside  dwarfs  and  dwarfish ), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the  Old English  plural survived, it would have been  dwarrows  or  dwerrows .) He also coined the term   eucatastrophe  , though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work. ,  In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \"[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\".  [183]   The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien\\'s legends. Personally known to him were  Pauline Baynes  (Tolkien\\'s favourite illustrator of   The Adventures of Tom Bombadil   and   Farmer Giles of Ham  ) and  Donald Swann  (who set the music to   The Road Goes Ever On  ). Queen  Margrethe II of Denmark  created illustrations to  The Lord of the Rings  in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.  [184]   ,  However, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of  The Hobbit  as \"too  Disnified  ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and  Gandalf  as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the  Odinic  wanderer that I think of\".  [185]   ,  Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging  Tolkien fandom  in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of  The Lord of the Rings : ,  Thank you for sending me the projected \\'blurbs\\', which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.  [149]   ,  He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \" On Fairy-Stories \", first presented in 1939: ,  In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ... Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy. Fantasy, even of the simplest kind, hardly ever succeeds in Drama, when that is presented as it should be, visibly and audibly acted.  [186]   ,  Tolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word  Tollywood , a portmanteau derived from \"Tolkien Hollywood\", to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in  Tolkien\\'s legendarium  aimed at generating good  box office  results, rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original.  [187]   ,  On receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of  The Lord of the Rings  by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote: ,  I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about.  [188]   ,  Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene (\"yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings\"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  to  United Artists  in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director  John Boorman  was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to  Tolkien Enterprises , a division of the  Saul Zaentz  Company, and the first film adaptation of   The Lord of the Rings   was released in 1978 as an animated  rotoscoping  film directed by  Ralph Bakshi  with screenplay by the fantasy writer  Peter S. Beagle . It covered only the first half of the story of  The Lord of the Rings .  [189]   In 1977, an  animated   musical   television film  of   The Hobbit   was made by  Rankin-Bass , and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film   The Return of the King  , which covered some of the portions of  The Lord of the Rings  that Bakshi was unable to complete. ,  From 2001 to 2003,  New Line Cinema  released   The Lord of the Rings   as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by  Peter Jackson . The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous  Oscars .  [190]   ,  From 2012 to 2014,  Warner Bros.  and  New Line Cinema  released   The Hobbit  , a series of three films based on  The Hobbit , with  Peter Jackson  serving as executive producer, director, and co-writer.  [191]   The first instalment,   The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  , was released in December 2012;  [192]   the second,   The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug  , in December 2013;  [193]   and the last instalment,   The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies  , in December 2014.  [194]   ,  Tolkien and the characters and places from his works have become the namesake of various things around the World. These include street names, mountains, companies, species of animals and plants as well as other notable objects. ,  By convention, certain classes of features on Saturn\\'s moon  Titan  are named after elements from Middle-earth.  [195]     Colles   (small hills or knobs) are named for characters,  [196]   while   montes   (mountains) are named for mountains of Middle-earth.  [197]   There are also  asteroids  named for  Bilbo Baggins  and Tolkien himself.  [198]    [199]   ,  Three mountains in the  Cadwallader Range  of  British Columbia , Canada, have been named after Tolkien\\'s characters. These are Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn.  [200]    [201]   On 1 December 2012, it was announced in the New Zealand press that a bid was launched for the  New Zealand Geographic Board  to name a mountain peak near  Milford Sound  after Tolkien for historical and literary reasons and to mark Tolkien\\'s 121st birthday.  [202]   ,  The \"Tolkien Road\" in  Eastbourne , East Sussex, was named after Tolkien whereas the \"Tolkien Way\" in  Stoke-on-Trent  is named after Tolkien\\'s eldest son, Fr. John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains.  [203]   In the  Hall Green  and  Moseley  areas of  Birmingham  there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien—most notably, the Millstream Way and  Moseley Bog .  [204]   Collectively the parks are known as the Shire Country Parks.  [204]   Also in  Weston-super-Mare , Somerset, England there are a collection of roads in the \\'Weston Village\\' named after locales of Middle Earth, namely Hobbiton Road, Bree Close, Arnor Close, Rivendell, Westmarch Way and Buckland Green. ,  In the Dutch town of  Geldrop , near  Eindhoven , the streets of an entire new neighbourhood are named after Tolkien himself (\"Laan van Tolkien\") and some of the best-known characters from his books. ,  In the Silicon Valley towns of  Saratoga  and  San Jose  in California, there are two housing developments with street names drawn from Tolkien\\'s works. About a dozen Tolkien-derived street names also appear scattered throughout the town of  Lake Forest, California . The  Columbia , Maryland, neighbourhood of Hobbit\\'s Glen and its street names (including  Rivendell  Lane, Tooks Way, and Oakenshield Circle) come from Tolkien\\'s works.  [205]   ,  In the field of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given scientific names honouring, or deriving from, characters or other fictional elements from   The Lord of the Rings  ,   The Hobbit  , and other works set in  Middle-earth .  [206]   Several taxa have been named after the character  Gollum  (also known as Sméagol), as well as for various  hobbits , the small humanlike creatures such as  Bilbo  and  Frodo Baggins . Various  elves ,  dwarves , and other creatures that appear in his writings as well as Tolkien himself have been honoured in the names of several species, including the amphipod   Leucothoe tolkieni  , and the wasp   Shireplitis tolkieni  . In 2004, the extinct hominid   Homo floresiensis   was described, and quickly earned the nickname \"hobbit\" due to its small size.  [207]   In 1978, Paleontologist  Leigh Van Valen  named over 20 taxa of extinct mammals after Tolkien lore in a single paper.  [208]    [209]   In 1999, entomologist Lauri Kaila described 48 new species of   Elachista   moths and named 37 of them after Tolkien mythology.  [206]    [210]   It has been noted that \"Tolkien has been accorded formal taxonomic commemoration like no other author.\"  [211]   ,  Since 2003  The Tolkien Society  has organized  Tolkien Reading Day , which takes place on 25 March in schools around the world.  [212]   ,  There are seven  blue plaques  in England that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham and one in Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote  The Hobbit  and most of  The Lord of the Rings . ,  Another two plaques marking buildings associated with Tolkien are:- ,  In 2012, Tolkien was among the  British cultural icons  selected by artist Sir  Peter Blake  to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles\\'   Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band   album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

       "['[ In  mathematics , an  integral  assigns numbers to functions in a way that can describe displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. Integration is one of the two main operations of  calculus , with its inverse,  differentiation , being the other. Given a  function   f  of a  real   variable   x  and an  interval   [ a ,  b ]  of the  real line , the  definite integral  ,  is defined informally as the signed  area  of the region in the  xy -plane that is bounded by the  graph  of  f , the  x -axis and the vertical lines   x  =  a   and   x  =  b  . The area above the  x -axis adds to the total and that below the  x -axis subtracts from the total. ,  Roughly speaking, the operation of integration is the reverse of differentiation. For this reason, the term  integral  may also refer to the related notion of the  antiderivative , a function  F  whose  derivative  is the given function  f . In this case, it is called an   indefinite integral   and is written: ,  The integrals discussed in this article are those termed  definite integrals . It is the  fundamental theorem of calculus  that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if  f  is a continuous real-valued function defined on a  closed interval   [ a ,  b ] , then, once an antiderivative  F  of  f  is known, the definite integral of  f  over that interval is given by ,  The principles of integration were formulated independently by  Isaac Newton  and  Gottfried Leibniz  in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of  infinitesimal  width. A rigorous mathematical definition of the integral was given by  Bernhard Riemann . It is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a  curvilinear  region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the  domain  over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A  line integral  is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration  [ a ,  b ]  is replaced by a certain  curve  connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a  surface integral , the curve is replaced by a piece of a  surface  in the three-dimensional space. ,   ,   ,  The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the  method of exhaustion  of the  ancient Greek  astronomer  Eudoxus  ( ca.  370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by  Archimedes  in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for  parabolas  and an approximation to the area of a circle. ,  A similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by  Liu Hui , who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians  Zu Chongzhi  and  Zu Geng  to find the volume of a sphere ( Shea 2007 ;  Katz 2004 , pp.\\xa0125–126). ,  The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of  Cavalieri  with his  method of Indivisibles , and work by  Fermat , began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of   x   n    up to degree   n  = 9  in  Cavalieri\\'s quadrature formula . Further steps were made in the early 17th century by  Barrow  and  Torricelli , who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and  differentiation . Barrow provided the first proof of the  fundamental theorem of calculus .  Wallis  generalized Cavalieri\\'s method, computing integrals of  x  to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers. ,  The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the  fundamental theorem of calculus  by  Newton  and  Leibniz . The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern  calculus , whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz. ,  While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of  rigour .  Bishop Berkeley  memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them \" ghosts of departed quantities \". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of  limits . Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by  Riemann . Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of  Fourier analysis —to which Riemann\\'s definition does not apply, and  Lebesgue  formulated a different definition of integral, founded in  measure theory  (a subfield of  real analysis ). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann\\'s and Lebesgue\\'s approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the  standard part  of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the  hyperreal number  system. ,   Isaac Newton  used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with      .    x      or   x ′ , which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted. ,  The modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by  Gottfried Leibniz  in 1675 ( Burton 1988 , p.\\xa0359;  Leibniz 1899 , p.\\xa0154). He adapted the  integral symbol ,  ∫ , from the letter  ſ  ( long s ), standing for  summa  (written as  ſumma ; Latin for \"sum\" or \"total\"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by  Joseph Fourier  in  Mémoires  of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in his book of 1822 ( Cajori 1929 , pp.\\xa0249–250;  Fourier 1822 , §231). ,  The integral with respect to  x  of a  real-valued function    f ( x )  of a real variable  x  on the interval  [ a ,  b ]  is written as ,  The integral sign  ∫  represents integration. The symbol  dx , called the  differential  of the variable  x , indicates that the variable of integration is  x . The function   f ( x )  to be integrated is called the integrand. The symbol  dx  is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown). If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The points  a  and  b  are called the limits of the integral. An integral where the limits are specified is called a definite integral. The integral is said to be over the interval  [ a ,  b ] . ,  When the limits are omitted, as in ,  the integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the  antiderivative ) whose derivative is the integrand. The  fundamental theorem of calculus  relates the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. Occasionally, limits of integration are omitted for definite integrals when the same limits occur repeatedly in a particular context. Usually, the author will make this convention clear at the beginning of the relevant text. ,  There are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article). ,  Historically, the symbol  dx  was taken to represent an infinitesimally \"small piece\" of the independent variable  x  to be multiplied by the integrand and summed up in an infinite sense. While this notion is still heuristically useful, later mathematicians have deemed infinitesimal quantities to be untenable from the standpoint of the real number system.  [1]   In introductory calculus, the expression  dx  is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is viewed as part of the symbol for integration and serves as its delimiter. In more sophisticated contexts,  dx  can have its own significance, the meaning of which depending on the particular area of mathematics in question. The original Leibnitz notation was co-opted in various efforts to make precise and extend the definition of the integral to increasingly general scenarios, giving rise to several distinct usages. Some common interpretations of  dx  include: an integrator function in  Riemann-Stieltjes integration  (indicated by  dα ( x ) in general), a  measure  in Lebesgue theory (indicated by  dμ  in general), or a  differential form  in exterior calculus (indicated by    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n i \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ∧  \\n ⋯  \\n ∧  \\n d \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n i \\n \\n k \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  }\\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dx^ }} \\n \\n     in general). In the latter, even the letter  d  has an independent meaning — as the  exterior derivative  operator on forms. Moreover, in advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out  dx  when only the simple Riemann integral is being used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n b \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n c \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n f \\n + \\n \\n c \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n g \\n ) \\n = \\n \\n c \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n b \\n \\n \\n f \\n + \\n \\n c \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n b \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n  ^ (c_ f+c_ g)=c_ \\\\int _ ^ f+c_ \\\\int _ ^ g} \\n \\n     to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof. ,  In  modern Arabic mathematical notation , a reflected integral symbol     is used instead of the symbol  ∫ , since the Arabic script and mathematical expressions go right to left.  [2]   Some authors, particularly of European origin, use an upright \"d\" to indicate the variable of integration (i.e.,  d x   instead of   dx  ), since properly speaking, \"d\" is not a variable. Also, the symbol  dx  is not always placed after   f ( x ) , as for instance in ,  In the first expression, the differential is treated as an infinitesimal \"multiplicative\" factor, formally following a \"commutative property\" when \"multiplied\" by the expression 3/( x  2 +1). In the second expression, showing the differentials first highlights and clarifies the variables that are being integrated with respect to, a practice particularly popular with physicists. ,  Integrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but  precision engineering  (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements. ,  To start off, consider the curve   y  =  f ( x )  between   x  = 0  and   x  = 1  with   f ( x ) =  √  x     (see figure). We ask: ,  and call this (yet unknown) area the (definite)  integral  of  f . The notation for this integral will be ,  As a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides   x  = 0  to   x  = 1  and   y  =  f (0) = 0  and   y  =  f (1) = 1 . Its area is exactly 1. As it is, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles shall give a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus   √ 1/5   ,   √ 2/5   , and so on to   √ 1   = 1 . Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely ,  We are taking a sum of finitely many function values of  f , multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will never be exact: replacing the five subintervals by twelve in the same way, but with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203, which is too small. The key idea is the transition from adding  finitely many  differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or   infinitesimal   steps. ,  The notation ,  conceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated  s , of function values,   f ( x ) , multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called  differentials , denoted by  dx . The multiplication sign is usually omitted. ,  Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a  limit  of weighted sums, so that the  dx  suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann\\'s dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the  Lebesgue integral , which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of \"measure\" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation ,  refers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with  μ  measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here  A  denotes the region of integration. ,  There are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals. ,  The Riemann integral is defined in terms of  Riemann sums  of functions with respect to  tagged partitions  of an interval.  [3]   Let  [ a ,  b ]  be a  closed interval  of the real line; then a  tagged partition  of  [ a ,  b ]  is a finite sequence ,  This partitions the interval  [ a ,  b ]  into  n  sub-intervals  [ x   i −1 ,  x   i  ]  indexed by  i , each of which is \"tagged\" with a distinguished point   t   i   ∈ [ x   i −1 ,  x   i  ] . A  Riemann sum  of a function  f  with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as ,  thus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let  Δ  i   =  x   i  − x   i −1   be the width of sub-interval  i ; then the  mesh  of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition,  max  i =1... n   Δ  i   . The  Riemann integral  of a function  f  over the interval  [ a ,  b ]  is equal to  S  if: ,  When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower)  Darboux sum , suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the  Darboux integral . ,  It is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated ( Rudin 1987 ). ,  Such an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus  Henri Lebesgue  introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to  Paul Montel : ,  I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral. ,  As  Folland (1984 , p.\\xa056) puts it, \"To compute the Riemann integral of  f , one partitions the domain  [ a ,  b ]  into subintervals\", while in the Lebesgue integral, \"one is in effect partitioning the range of  f \". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a  measure , μ. In the simplest case, the  Lebesgue measure    μ ( A )  of an interval   A  = [ a ,  b ]  is its width,   b  −  a  , so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals. ,  Using the \"partitioning the range of  f \" philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function   f \\xa0:  R  →  R   should be the sum over  t  of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between   y  =  t   and   y  =  t  +  dt  . This area is just   μ  \\u2009 dt  . Let   f  ∗ ( t ) =  μ  . The Lebesgue integral of  f  is then defined by ( Lieb &amp; Loss 2001 ) ,  where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral (  f  ∗   is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a  well-defined  improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the  measurable functions ) this defines the Lebesgue integral. ,  A general measurable function  f  is Lebesgue-integrable if the area between the graph of  f  and the  x -axis is finite: ,  In that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the  x -axis and the area below the  x -axis: ,  where ,  Although the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including: ,  The collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval  [ a ,  b ]  forms a  vector space  under the operations of  pointwise addition  and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration ,  is a  linear functional  on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking  linear combinations ; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals, ,  Similarly, the set of  real -valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given  measure space   E  with measure  μ  is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral ,  is a linear functional on this vector space, so that ,  More generally, consider the vector space of all  measurable functions  on a measure space  ( E , μ ) , taking values in a  locally compact   complete   topological vector space   V  over a locally compact  topological field    K ,  f \\xa0:  E  →  V  . Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function  f  an element of  V  or the symbol   ∞  , ,  that is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of  V  (i.e. \"finite\"). The most important special cases arise when  K  is   R  ,   C  , or a finite extension of the field   Q   p    of  p-adic numbers , and  V  is a finite-dimensional vector space over  K , and when   K  =  C   and  V  is a complex  Hilbert space . ,  Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of \"simple\" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of  Daniell  for the case of real-valued functions on a set  X , generalized by  Nicolas Bourbaki  to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See ( Hildebrandt 1953 ) for an axiomatic characterisation of the integral. ,  A number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable  functions  defined on a  closed  and  bounded   interval   [ a ,  b ]  and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell). ,  In this section,  f  is a  real-valued  Riemann-integrable  function . The integral ,  over an interval  [ a ,  b ]  is defined if   a  &lt;  b  . This means that the upper and lower sums of the function  f  are evaluated on a partition   a  =  x  0  ≤  x  1  ≤ . . . ≤  x   n   =  b   whose values   x   i    are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place \"left to right\", evaluating  f  within intervals  [ x  \\u2009 i  \\u2009,  x  \\u2009 i \\u2009+1 ]  where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values  a  and  b , the end-points of the  interval , are called the  limits of integration  of  f . Integrals can also be defined if   a  &gt;  b  : ,  This, with   a  =  b  , implies: ,  The first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of  [ a ,  b ] ; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a  point , should be  zero . One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of  f  on an interval  [ a ,  b ]  implies that  f  is integrable on any subinterval  [ c ,  d ] , but in particular integrals have the property that: ,  With the first convention, the resulting relation ,  is then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of  a ,  b , and  c . ,  The  fundamental theorem of calculus  is the statement that  differentiation  and integration are inverse operations: if a  continuous function  is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved. An important consequence, sometimes called the  second fundamental theorem of calculus , allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated. ,  Let  f  be a continuous real-valued function defined on a  closed interval   [ a ,  b ] . Let  F  be the function defined, for all  x  in  [ a ,  b ] , by ,  Then,  F  is continuous on  [ a ,  b ] , differentiable on the open interval  ( a ,  b ) , and ,  for all  x  in  ( a ,  b ) . ,  Let  f  be a real-valued function defined on a  closed interval   [ a ,  b ]  that admits an  antiderivative   F  on  [ a ,  b ] . That is,  f  and  F  are functions such that for all  x  in  [ a ,  b ] , ,  If  f  is integrable on  [ a ,  b ]  then ,  The second fundamental theorem allows many integrals to be calculated explicitly. For example, to calculate the integral ,  of the square root function   f ( x ) =  x  1/2   between 0 and 1, it is sufficient to find an antiderivative, that is, a function   F ( x )  whose derivative equals   f ( x ) : ,  One such function is   F ( x ) =   2  /  3   x  3/2  . Then the value of the integral in question is ,  This is a case of a general rule, that for   f ( x ) =  x   q   , with   q  ≠ −1 , the related function, the so-called antiderivative is   F ( x ) =  x   q  + 1 /( q  + 1).  Tables of this and similar antiderivatives can be used to calculate integrals explicitly, in much the same way that tables of derivatives can be used. ,  A \"proper\" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the  limit  of a  sequence  of proper  Riemann integrals  on progressively larger intervals. ,  If the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity. ,  If the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance  ( a ,  b ] , then again a limit may provide a finite result. ,  That is, the improper integral is the  limit  of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified  real number , or  ∞ , or  −∞ . In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points. ,  Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the  area  of the region between the graph of the function and the  x -axis, the  double integral  of a positive function of two variables represents the  volume  of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane that contains its  domain . For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables,  x  and  y , and the integral of a function  f  over the rectangle  R  given as the  Cartesian product  of two intervals    \\n \\n \\n \\n R \\n = \\n [ \\n a \\n , \\n b \\n ] \\n ×  \\n [ \\n c \\n , \\n d \\n ] \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     can be written ,  where the differential   dA   indicates that integration is taken with respect to area. This  double integral  can be defined using  Riemann sums , and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of   z  =  f ( x , y )  over the domain  R . Under suitable conditions (e.g., if  f  is continuous), then  Fubini\\'s theorem  guarantees that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral ,  This reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because of this, another notation for the integral over  R  uses a double integral sign: ,  Integration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function  f , with respect to volume, over a subset  D  of ℝ n  is denoted by notation such as ,  or similar. See  volume integral . ,  The concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with  vector fields . ,  A  line integral  (sometimes called a  path integral ) is an integral where the  function  to be integrated is evaluated along a  curve . Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a  contour integral . ,  The function to be integrated may be a  scalar field  or a  vector field . The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly  arc length  or, for a vector field, the  scalar product  of the vector field with a  differential  vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on  intervals . Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that  work  is equal to  force ,   F  , multiplied by displacement,   s  , may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as: ,  For an object moving along a path   C   in a  vector field    F   such as an  electric field  or  gravitational field , the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from   s   to   s  +  d  s  . This gives the line integral ,  A  surface integral  is a definite integral taken over a  surface  (which may be a curved set in  space ); it can be thought of as the  double integral  analog of the  line integral . The function to be integrated may be a  scalar field  or a  vector field . The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums. ,  For an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field   v   on a surface   S  ; that is, for each point   x   in   S  ,   v ( x )  is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through   S  , such that   v ( x )  determines the velocity of the fluid at  x . The  flux  is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through   S   in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the  dot product  of   v   with the unit  surface normal  to   S   at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface: ,  The fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the  classical theory  of  electromagnetism . ,  In  complex analysis , the integrand is a  complex-valued function  of a complex variable  z  instead of a real function of a real variable  x . When a complex function is integrated along a curve    \\n \\n \\n \\n γ  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows ,  This is known as a  contour integral . ,  A  differential form  is a mathematical concept in the fields of  multivariable calculus ,  differential topology , and  tensors . Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as: ,  where  E ,  F ,  G  are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials  dx ,  dy ,  dz  measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes. ,  A differential two-form is a sum of the form ,  Here the basic two-forms    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n x \\n ∧  \\n d \\n y \\n , \\n d \\n z \\n ∧  \\n d \\n x \\n , \\n d \\n y \\n ∧  \\n d \\n z \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes. The symbol    \\n \\n \\n \\n ∧  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     denotes the  wedge product , which is similar to the  cross product  in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of    \\n \\n \\n \\n E \\n \\n i \\n \\n + \\n F \\n \\n j \\n \\n + \\n G \\n \\n k \\n \\n \\n \\n   +F\\\\mathbf   +G\\\\mathbf   } \\n \\n    . ,  Unlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The  exterior derivative  plays the role of the  gradient  and  curl  of vector calculus, and  Stokes\\' theorem  simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the  divergence theorem ,  Green\\'s theorem , and the  Kelvin-Stokes theorem . ,  The discrete equivalent of integration is  summation . Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of  Lebesgue integrals  or  time scale calculus . ,  The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the  fundamental theorem of calculus . Let   f ( x )  be the function of  x  to be integrated over a given interval  [ a ,  b ] . Then, find an antiderivative of  f ; that is, a function  F  such that   F ′ =  f   on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no  singularities  on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, ,  The integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals. ,  The most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of  f . It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include: ,  Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many  nonelementary integrals  can be expanded in a  Taylor series  and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using  Meijer G-functions  can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance,  Parseval\\'s identity  can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see  Gaussian integral . ,  Computations of volumes of  solids of revolution  can usually be done with  disk integration  or  shell integration . ,  Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the  list of integrals . ,  Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive  tables of integrals  have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to  computer algebra systems  that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like  Macsyma . ,  A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions  exp( x  2 ),  x   x    and  (sin  x )/ x   cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only  rational  and  exponential  functions,  logarithm ,  trigonometric functions  and  inverse trigonometric functions , and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in  elementary functions , which are the functions which may be built from rational functions,  roots of a polynomial , logarithm, and exponential functions. The  Risch algorithm  provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the \\'building blocks\\' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The  Risch algorithm , implemented in  Mathematica  and other  computer algebra systems , does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions,  radicals , logarithm, and exponential functions. ,  Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the  special functions  (like the  Legendre functions , the  hypergeometric function , the  gamma function , the  incomplete gamma function  and so on\\xa0— see  Symbolic integration  for more details). Extending the Risch\\'s algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject. ,  More recently a new approach has emerged, using   D -finite functions , which are the solutions of  linear differential equations  with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are  D -finite, and the integral of a  D -finite function is also a  D -finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a  D -finite function as the solution of a differential equation. ,  This theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a  D -function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.  [4]   ,  Some integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives. Others are not so accommodating. Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions that themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called  numerical integration  or  numerical quadrature , arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements. The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures ( Dahlquist &amp; Björck 2008 ;  Kahaner, Moler &amp; Nash 1989 ;  Stoer &amp; Bulirsch 2002 ). ,  Consider, for example, the integral ,  which has the exact answer  94/25 = 3.76 . (In ordinary practice, the answer is not known in advance, so an important task\\xa0— not explored here\\xa0— is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values. ,  Using the left end of each piece, the  rectangle method  sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width,  h , here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2 18  pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle. ,  A better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The  trapezoid rule  is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2 10  pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further.  Simpson\\'s rule  approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson\\'s rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called  Newton–Cotes formulas . The degree   n   Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree   n   polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson\\'s rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to  Runge\\'s phenomenon . One solution to this problem is  Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature , in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of  Chebyshev polynomials . This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function. ,   Romberg\\'s method  builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by   T ( h  0 ),  T ( h  1 ) , and so on, where   h   k +1   is half of   h   k   . For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to  interpolate  a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to   T (0) . With this method a numerically  exact  answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The  Lagrange polynomial  interpolating     k  = 0...2  =    is 3.76 + 0.148  h  2  , producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at   h  = 0 . ,   Gaussian quadrature  often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two  x  positions,  ±2 ⁄  √ 3   , then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton–Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of  orthogonal polynomials . An  n -point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to  2 n  − 1 . The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.) ,  In practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular  Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formulae . More broadly,  adaptive quadrature  partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most. ,  The computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as  Monte Carlo integration . ,  A calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage. For example, the integral    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n −  \\n 1 \\n \\n / \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n e \\n \\n −  \\n x \\n \\n \\n  \\n d \\n x \\n \\n \\n  ^ x^ e^ \\\\,dx} \\n \\n     is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at   x  = 0 . However, the substitution   u  = √ x   transforms the integral into    \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n ∫  \\n \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n e \\n \\n −  \\n \\n u \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n d \\n u \\n \\n \\n  ^ e^ }\\\\,du} \\n \\n    , which has no singularities at all. ,  The area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called  planimeter . The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid  displaced  as the object is submerged. ,  Area can be found via  geometrical   compass-and-straightedge constructions  of an equivalent  square , e.g.,  squaring the circle . ]',\n",
       " '[ In the branch of  mathematics  known as  real analysis , the  Riemann integral , created by  Bernhard Riemann , was the first rigorous definition of the  integral  of a  function  on an  interval . It was presented to the faculty at the  University of Göttingen  in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868.  [1]   For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the  fundamental theorem of calculus  or approximated by  numerical integration . ,  The Riemann integral is unsuitable for many theoretical purposes. Some of the technical deficiencies in Riemann integration can be remedied with the  Riemann–Stieltjes integral , and most disappear with the  Lebesgue integral . ,   ,   ,  Let  f  be a nonnegative  real -valued function on the interval  [ a ,  b ] , and let ,  be the region of the plane under the graph of the function  f  and above the interval  [ a ,  b ]  (see the figure on the top right). We are interested in measuring the area of  S . Once we have measured it, we will denote the area by: ,  The basic idea of the Riemann integral is to use very simple approximations for the area of  S . By taking better and better approximations, we can say that \"in the limit\" we get exactly the area of  S  under the curve. ,  Note that where  f  can be both positive and negative, the definition of  S  is modified so that the integral corresponds to the  signed area  under the graph of  f : that is, the area above the  x -axis minus the area below the  x -axis. ,  A  partition of an interval   [ a ,  b ]  is a finite sequence of numbers of the form ,  Each  [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ]  is called a  subinterval  of the partition. The  mesh  or  norm  of a partition is defined to be the length of the longest subinterval, that is, ,  A  tagged partition    P ( x ,  t )  of an interval  [ a ,  b ]  is a partition together with a finite sequence of numbers   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   subject to the conditions that for each  i ,   t i   ∈ [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ] . In other words, it is a partition together with a distinguished point of every subinterval. The mesh of a tagged partition is the same as that of an ordinary partition. ,  Suppose that two partitions   P ( x ,  t )  and   Q ( y ,  s )  are both partitions of the interval  [ a ,  b ] . We say that   Q ( y ,  s )  is a  refinement  of   P ( x ,  t )  if for each integer  i , with   i  ∈ [0,  n ] , there exists an integer   r ( i )  such that   x i   =  y   r ( i )   and such that   t i   =  s j    for some  j  with   j  ∈ [ r ( i ),  r ( i  + 1)) . Said more simply, a refinement of a tagged partition breaks up some of the subintervals and adds tags to the partition where necessary, thus it \"refines\" the accuracy of the partition. ,  We can define a  partial order  on the set of all tagged partitions by saying that one tagged partition is greater or equal to another if the former is a refinement of the latter. ,  Let  f  be a real-valued function defined on the interval  [ a ,  b ] . The   Riemann sum   of  f  with respect to the tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    together with   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   is  [2]   ,  Each term in the sum is the product of the value of the function at a given point and the length of an interval. Consequently, each term represents the (signed) area of a rectangle with height   f ( t i  )  and width   x   i  + 1  −  x i   . The Riemann sum is the (signed) area of all the rectangles. ,  A closely related concept are the  lower and upper Darboux sums . These are similar to Riemann sums, but the tags are replaced by the  infimum and supremum  (respectively) of  f  on each subinterval: ,  If  f  is continuous, then the lower and upper Darboux sums for an untagged partition are equal to the Riemann sum for that partition, where the tags are chosen to be the minimum or maximum (respectively) of  f  on each subinterval. (When  f  is discontinuous on a subinterval, there may not be a tag that achieves the infimum or supremum on that subinterval.) The  Darboux integral , which is similar to the Riemann integral but based on Darboux sums, is equivalent to the Riemann integral. ,  Loosely speaking, the Riemann integral is the limit of the Riemann sums of a function as the partitions get finer. If the limit exists then the function is said to be  integrable  (or more specifically  Riemann-integrable ). The Riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the Riemann integral by making the partition fine enough.  [3]   ,  One important requirement is that the mesh of the partitions must become smaller and smaller, so that in the limit, it is zero. If this were not so, then we would not be getting a good approximation to the function on certain subintervals. In fact, this is enough to define an integral. To be specific, we say that the Riemann integral of  f  equals  s  if the following condition holds: ,  For all   ε  &gt; 0 , there exists  δ  such that for any tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   whose mesh is less than  δ , we have ,  Unfortunately, this definition is very difficult to use. It would help to develop an equivalent definition of the Riemann integral which is easier to work with. We develop this definition now, with a proof of equivalence following. Our new definition says that the Riemann integral of  f  equals  s  if the following condition holds: ,  For all   ε  &gt; 0 , there exists a tagged partition   y  0 , ...,  y m    and   r  0 , ...,  r   m  − 1   such that for any tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   which is a refinement of   y  0 , ...,  y m    and   r  0 , ...,  r   m  − 1  , we have ,  Both of these mean that eventually, the Riemann sum of  f  with respect to any partition gets trapped close to  s . Since this is true no matter how close we demand the sums be trapped, we say that the Riemann sums converge to  s . These definitions are actually a special case of a more general concept, a  net . ,  As we stated earlier, these two definitions are equivalent. In other words,  s  works in the first definition if and only if  s  works in the second definition. To show that the first definition implies the second, start with an  ε , and choose a  δ  that satisfies the condition. Choose any tagged partition whose mesh is less than  δ . Its Riemann sum is within  ε  of  s , and any refinement of this partition will also have mesh less than  δ , so the Riemann sum of the refinement will also be within  ε  of  s . ,  To show that the second definition implies the first, it is easiest to use the  Darboux integral . First, one shows that the second definition is equivalent to the definition of the Darboux integral; for this see the article on Darboux integration. Now we will show that a Darboux integrable function satisfies the first definition. Fix  ε , and choose a partition   y  0 , ...,  y m    such that the lower and upper Darboux sums with respect to this partition are within   ε /2  of the value  s  of the Darboux integral. Let ,  If   r  = 0 , then  f  is the zero function, which is clearly both Darboux and Riemann integrable with integral zero. Therefore, we will assume that   r  &gt; 0 . If   m  &gt; 1 , then we choose  δ  such that ,  If   m  = 1 , then we choose  δ  to be less than one. Choose a tagged partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   with mesh smaller than  δ . We must show that the Riemann sum is within  ε  of  s . ,  To see this, choose an interval  [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ] . If this interval is contained within some  [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] , then ,  where  m j   and  M j   are respectively, the infimum and the supremum of  f  on  [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] . If all intervals had this property, then this would conclude the proof, because each term in the Riemann sum would be bounded by a corresponding term in the Darboux sums, and we chose the Darboux sums to be near  s . This is the case when   m  = 1 , so the proof is finished in that case. ,  Therefore, we may assume that   m  &gt; 1 . In this case, it is possible that one of the  [ x i  ,  x   i  + 1 ]  is not contained in any  [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] . Instead, it may stretch across two of the intervals determined by   y  0 , ...,  y m   . (It cannot meet three intervals because  δ  is assumed to be smaller than the length of any one interval.) In symbols, it may happen that ,  (We may assume that all the inequalities are strict because otherwise we are in the previous case by our assumption on the length of  δ .) This can happen at most   m  − 1  times. ,  To handle this case, we will estimate the difference between the Riemann sum and the Darboux sum by subdividing the partition   x  0 , ...,  x n    at   y   j  + 1  . The term   f ( t i  )( x   i  + 1  −  x i  )  in the Riemann sum splits into two terms: ,  Suppose, without loss of generality, that   t i   ∈ [ y j  ,  y   j  + 1 ] . Then ,  so this term is bounded by the corresponding term in the Darboux sum for  y j  . To bound the other term, notice that ,  It follows that, for some (indeed any)   t  * \\n i   ∈ [ y   j  + 1 ,  x   i  + 1 ] , ,  Since this happens at most   m  − 1  times, the distance between the Riemann sum and a Darboux sum is at most   ε /2 . Therefore, the distance between the Riemann sum and  s  is at most\\xa0 ε . ,  Let   f \\xa0: [0, 1] →  R   be the function which takes the value 1 at every point. Any Riemann sum of  f  on  [0, 1]  will have the value 1, therefore the Riemann integral of  f  on  [0, 1]  is 1. ,  Let   I   Q  \\xa0: [0, 1] →  R   be the  indicator function  of the rational numbers in  [0, 1] ; that is,   I   Q    takes the value 1 on rational numbers and 0 on irrational numbers. This function does not have a Riemann integral. To prove this, we will show how to construct tagged partitions whose Riemann sums get arbitrarily close to both zero and one. ,  To start, let   x  0 , ...,  x n    and   t  0 , ...,  t   n  − 1   be a tagged partition (each  t i   is between  x i   and   x   i  + 1  ). Choose   ε  &gt; 0 . The  t i   have already been chosen, and we can\\'t change the value of  f  at those points. But if we cut the partition into tiny pieces around each  t i  , we can minimize the effect of the  t i  . Then, by carefully choosing the new tags, we can make the value of the Riemann sum turn out to be within  ε  of either zero or one. ,  Our first step is to cut up the partition. There are  n  of the  t i  , and we want their total effect to be less than  ε . If we confine each of them to an interval of length less than   ε / n  , then the contribution of each  t i   to the Riemann sum will be at least  0 ·  ε / n   and at most  1 ·  ε / n  . This makes the total sum at least zero and at most  ε . So let  δ  be a positive number less than   ε / n  . If it happens that two of the  t i   are within  δ  of each other, choose  δ  smaller. If it happens that some  t i   is within  δ  of some  x j  , and  t i   is not equal to  x j  , choose  δ  smaller. Since there are only finitely many  t i   and  x j  , we can always choose  δ  sufficiently small. ,  Now we add two cuts to the partition for each  t i  . One of the cuts will be at   t i   −  δ /2 , and the other will be at   t i   +  δ /2 . If one of these leaves the interval [0, 1], then we leave it out.  t i   will be the tag corresponding to the subinterval ,  If  t i   is directly on top of one of the  x j  , then we let  t i   be the tag for both intervals: ,  We still have to choose tags for the other subintervals. We will choose them in two different ways. The first way is to always choose a  rational point , so that the Riemann sum is as large as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at least  1 −  ε  . The second way is to always choose an irrational point, so that the Riemann sum is as small as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at most  ε . ,  Since we started from an arbitrary partition and ended up as close as we wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number  s , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is  Lebesgue integrable . In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero  almost everywhere . But this is a fact that is beyond the reach of the Riemann integral. ,  There are even worse examples.   I   Q    is equivalent (that is, equal almost everywhere) to a Riemann integrable function, but there are non-Riemann integrable bounded functions which are not equivalent to any Riemann integrable function. For example, let  C  be the  Smith–Volterra–Cantor set , and let   I   C    be its indicator function. Because  C  is not  Jordan measurable ,   I   C    is not Riemann integrable. Moreover, no function  g  equivalent to   I   C    is Riemann integrable:  g , like   I   C   , must be zero on a dense set, so as in the previous example, any Riemann sum of  g  has a refinement which is within  ε  of 0 for any positive number\\xa0 ε . But if the Riemann integral of  g  exists, then it must equal the Lebesgue integral of   I   C   , which is  1/2 . Therefore,  g  is not Riemann integrable. ,  It is popular to define the Riemann integral as the  Darboux integral . This is because the Darboux integral is technically simpler and because a function is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is Darboux-integrable. ,  Some calculus books do not use general tagged partitions, but limit themselves to specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions may appear to be integrable. ,  One popular restriction is the use of \"left-hand\" and \"right-hand\" Riemann sums. In a left-hand Riemann sum,   t i   =  x i    for all  i , and in a right-hand Riemann sum,   t i   =  x   i  + 1   for all  i . Alone this restriction does not impose a problem: we can refine any partition in a way that makes it a left-hand or right-hand sum by subdividing it at each  t i  . In more formal language, the set of all left-hand Riemann sums and the set of all right-hand Riemann sums is  cofinal  in the set of all tagged partitions. ,  Another popular restriction is the use of regular subdivisions of an interval. For example, the  n th regular subdivision of  [0, 1]  consists of the intervals ,  Again, alone this restriction does not impose a problem, but the reasoning required to see this fact is more difficult than in the case of left-hand and right-hand Riemann sums. ,  However, combining these restrictions, so that one uses only left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums on regularly divided intervals, is dangerous. If a function is known in advance to be Riemann integrable, then this technique will give the correct value of the integral. But under these conditions the  indicator function    I   Q    will appear to be integrable on  [0, 1]  with integral equal to one: Every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number, so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers, and hence it will appear to always equal one. The problem with this definition becomes apparent when we try to split the integral into two pieces. The following equation ought to hold: ,  If we use regular subdivisions and left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums, then the two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1. ,  As defined above, the Riemann integral avoids this problem by refusing to integrate   I   Q   . The Lebesgue integral is defined in such a way that all these integrals are 0. ,  The Riemann integral is a linear transformation; that is, if  f  and  g  are Riemann-integrable on  [ a ,  b ]  and  α  and  β  are constants, then ,  Because the Riemann integral of a function is a number, this makes the Riemann integral a  linear functional  on the  vector space  of Riemann-integrable functions. ,  A  bounded function  on a  compact interval   [ a ,  b ]  is Riemann integrable if and only if it is  continuous   almost everywhere  (the set of its points of discontinuity has  measure zero , in the sense of  Lebesgue measure ). This is known as the     Lebesgue\\'s integrability condition   or  Lebesgue\\'s criterion for Riemann integrability  or the  Riemann–Lebesgue theorem .  [4]   The criterion has  nothing to do  with the  Lebesgue integral . It is due to  Lebesgue  and uses his  measure zero , but makes use of neither Lebesgue\\'s general measure or integral. ,  The integrability condition can be proven in various ways,  [4]    [5]    [6]    [7]   one of which is sketched below. ,  One direction can be proven using the  oscillation  definition of continuity:  [8]   For every positive  ε , Let   X   ε    be the set of points in  [ a ,  b ]  with oscillation of at least  ε . Since every point where  f  is discontinuous has a positive oscillation and vice versa, the set of points in  [ a ,  b ] , where  f  is discontinuous is equal to the union over     for all natural numbers  n . ,  If this set does not have a zero  Lebesgue measure , then by  countable additivity  of the measure there is at least one such  n  so that   X  1/ n    does not have a zero measure. Thus there is some positive number  c  such that every  countable  collection of open intervals  covering    X  1/ n    has a total length of at least  c . In particular this is also true for every such finite collection of intervals. Note that this remains true also for   X  1/ n    less a finite number of points (as a finite number of points can always be covered by a finite collection of intervals with arbitrarily small total length). ,  For every  partition of  [ a ,  b ]  , consider the set of intervals whose interiors include points from   X  1/ n   . These interiors consist of a finite open cover of   X  1/ n   , possibly up to a finite number of points (which may fall on interval edges). Thus these intervals have a total length of at least  c . Since in these points  f  has oscillation of at least  1/ n  , the  infimum and supremum  of  f  in each of these intervals differ by at least  1/ n  . Thus the upper and lower sums of  f  differ by at least   c / n  . Since this is true for every partition,  f  is not Riemann integrable. ,  We now prove the converse direction using the sets   X   ε    defined above.  [9]   Note that for every  ε ,   X   ε    is  compact , as it is bounded (by  a  and  b ) and closed: ,  Now, suppose that  f  is continuous  almost everywhere . Then for every  ε ,   X   ε    has zero  Lebesgue measure . Therefore, there is a countable collections of open intervals in  [ a ,  b ]  which is an  open cover  of   X   ε   , such that the sum over all their lengths is arbitrarily small.  Since   X   ε    is compact , there is a finite  subcover  – a finite collections of open intervals in  [ a ,  b ]  with arbitrarily small total length that together contain all points in   X   ε   . We denote these intervals    , for  1 ≤  i  ≤  k  , for some natural  k . ,  The  complement  of the union of these intervals is itself a union of a finite number of intervals, which we denote     (for  1 ≤  i  ≤  k  − 1  and possibly for   i  =  k ,  k  + 1  as well). ,  We now show that for every   ε  &gt; 0 , there are  upper and lower sums  whose difference is less than  ε , from which Riemann integrability follows. To this end, we construct a  partition of  [ a ,  b ]   as follows: ,  Denote   ε  1  =  ε  / 2( b  −  a )  and   ε  2  =  ε  / 2( M  −  m ) , where  m  and  M  are the  infimum and supremum  of  f  on  [ a ,  b ] . Since we may choose intervals     with arbitrarily small total length, we choose them to have total length smaller than   ε  2  . ,  Each of the intervals     has an empty intersection with   X   ε  1   , so each point in it has a neighborhood with oscillation smaller than   ε  1  . These neighborhoods consist of an  open cover  of the interval, and since the interval is compact there is a finite subcover of them. This subcover is a finite collection of open intervals, which are subintervals of   J ( ε  1 )  i    (except for those that include an edge point, for which we only take their intersection with   J ( ε  1 )  i  ) . We take the edge points of the subintervals for all   J ( ε  1 )  i   −  s  , including the edge points of the intervals themselves, as our partition. ,  Thus the partition divides  [ a ,  b ]  to two kinds of intervals: ,  In total, the difference between the upper and lower sums of the partition is smaller than  ε , as required. ,  In particular, any set that is at most  countable  has  Lebesgue measure  zero, and thus a bounded function (on a compact interval) with only finitely or countably many discontinuities is Riemann integrable. ,  An  indicator function  of a bounded set is Riemann-integrable if and only if the set is  Jordan measurable .  [10]   The Riemann integral can be interpreted  measure-theoretically  as the integral with respect to the Jordan measure. ,  If a real-valued function is  monotone  on the interval  [ a ,  b ]  it is Riemann-integrable, since its set of discontinuities is at most countable, and therefore of Lebesgue measure zero. ,  If a real-valued function on  [ a ,  b ]  is Riemann-integrable, it is  Lebesgue-integrable . That is, Riemann-integrability is a  stronger  (meaning more difficult to satisfy) condition than Lebesgue-integrability. ,  If   f   n    is a  uniformly convergent  sequence on  [ a ,  b ]  with limit  f , then Riemann integrability of all   f   n    implies Riemann integrability of  f , and ,  However, the  Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem  (on a monotone pointwise limit) does not hold. In Riemann integration, taking limits under the integral sign is far more difficult to logically justify than in Lebesgue integration.  [11]   ,  It is easy to extend the Riemann integral to functions with values in the Euclidean vector space   R   n    for any  n . The integral is defined component-wise; in other words, if   f  = ( f  1 , ...,  f   n  )  then ,  In particular, since the complex numbers are a real  vector space , this allows the integration of complex valued functions. ,  The Riemann integral is only defined on bounded intervals, and it does not extend well to unbounded intervals. The simplest possible extension is to define such an integral as a limit, in other words, as an  improper integral : ,  This definition carries with it some subtleties, such as the fact that it is not always equivalent to compute the  Cauchy principal value  ,  For example, consider the function   f ( x )  which is 0 at   x  = 0 , 1 for   x  &gt; 0 , and −1 for   x  &lt; 0 . By symmetry, ,  always, regardless of  a . But there are many ways for the interval of integration to expand to fill the real line, and other ways can produce different results; in other words, the multivariate limit does not always exist. We can compute ,  In general, this improper Riemann integral is undefined. Even standardizing a way for the interval to approach the real line does not work because it leads to disturbingly counterintuitive results. If we agree (for instance) that the improper integral should always be ,  then the integral of the translation   f ( x  − 1)  is −2, so this definition is not invariant under shifts, a highly undesirable property. In fact, not only does this function not have an improper Riemann integral, its Lebesgue integral is also undefined (it equals  ∞ − ∞ ). ,  Unfortunately, the improper Riemann integral is not powerful enough. The most severe problem is that there are no widely applicable theorems for commuting improper Riemann integrals with limits of functions. In applications such as  Fourier series  it is important to be able to approximate the integral of a function using integrals of approximations to the function. For proper Riemann integrals, a standard theorem states that if   f   n    is a sequence of functions that  converge uniformly  to  f  on a compact set  [ a ,  b ] , then ,  On non-compact intervals such as the real line, this is false. For example, take   f   n  ( x )  to be   n  −1   on  [0,  n ]  and zero elsewhere. For all  n  we have: ,  The sequence     converges uniformly to the zero function, and clearly the integral of the zero function is zero. Consequently, ,  This demonstrates that for integrals on unbounded intervals, uniform convergence of a function is not strong enough to allow passing a limit through an integral sign. This makes the Riemann integral unworkable in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands. ,  A better route is to abandon the Riemann integral for the  Lebesgue integral . The definition of the Lebesgue integral is not obviously a generalization of the Riemann integral, but it is not hard to prove that every Riemann-integrable function is Lebesgue-integrable and that the values of the two integrals agree whenever they are both defined. Moreover, a function  f  defined on a bounded interval is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is bounded and the set of points where  f  is discontinuous has Lebesgue measure zero. ,  An integral which is in fact a direct generalization of the Riemann integral is the  Henstock–Kurzweil integral . ,  Another way of generalizing the Riemann integral is to replace the factors   x   k  + 1  −  x   k    in the definition of a Riemann sum by something else; roughly speaking, this gives the interval of integration a different notion of length. This is the approach taken by the  Riemann–Stieltjes integral . ,  In  multivariable calculus , the Riemann integrals for functions from   R   n   →  R   are  multiple integrals . ]',\n",
       " '[ In  mathematics , the  Riemann–Stieltjes integral  is a generalization of the  Riemann integral , named after  Bernhard Riemann  and  Thomas Joannes Stieltjes . The definition of this integral was first published in 1894 by Stieltjes.  [1]   It serves as an instructive and useful precursor of the  Lebesgue integral , and an invaluable tool in unifying equivalent forms of statistical theorems that apply to discrete and continuous probability. ,   ,   ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes  integral  of a  real -valued function  f  of a real variable with respect to a real function  g  is denoted by ,  and defined to be the limit, as the  norm  (or  mesh ) of the  partition  ,  of the interval [ a ,\\xa0 b ] approaches zero, of the approximating sum ,  where  c   i   is in the  i -th subinterval [ x   i  ,\\xa0 x   i +1 ]. The two functions  f  and  g  are respectively called the integrand and the integrator. ,  The \"limit\" is here understood to be a number  A  (the value of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral) such that for every  ε \\xa0&gt;\\xa00, there exists  δ \\xa0&gt;\\xa00 such that for every partition  P  with mesh( P )\\xa0&lt;\\xa0 δ , and for every choice of points  c   i   in [ x   i  ,\\xa0 x   i +1 ], ,  A slight generalization, introduced by  Pollard (1920)  and now standard in analysis, is to consider in the above definition partitions  P  that  refine  another partition  P   ε  , meaning that  P  arises from  P   ε   by the addition of points, rather than from partitions with a finer mesh. Specifically, the  generalized Riemann–Stieltjes integral  of  f  with respect to  g  is a number  A  such that for every  ε \\xa0&gt;\\xa00 there exists a partition  P   ε   such that for every partition  P  that refines  P   ε  , ,  for every choice of points  c   i   in [ x   i  ,\\xa0 x   i +1 ]. ,  This generalization exhibits the Riemann–Stieltjes integral as the  Moore–Smith limit  on the  directed set  of partitions of [ a ,\\xa0 b ] ( McShane 1952 ).  Hildebrandt (1938)  calls it the  Pollard–Moore–Stieltjes integral . ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral can be efficiently handled using an appropriate generalization of  Darboux sums . For a partition  P  and a nondecreasing function  g  on [ a ,\\xa0 b ] define the upper Darboux sum of  f  with respect to  g  by ,  and the lower sum by ,  Then the generalized Riemann–Stieltjes of  f  with respect to  g  exists if and only if, for every ε\\xa0&gt;\\xa00, there exists a partition  P  such that ,  Furthermore,  f  is Riemann–Stieltjes integrable with respect to  g  (in the classical sense) if ,  See  Graves (1946 , Chap. XII, §3). ,  If  g  should happen to be everywhere  differentiable , then the Riemann–Stieltjes integral may still be different from the  Riemann integral  of    \\n \\n \\n \\n f \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n \\n g \\n ′ \\n \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     given by ,  for example, if the derivative    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n ′ \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is unbounded. But if the derivative    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n ′ \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is continuous, both integrals coincide. More generally, the Riemann integral equals the Riemann-Stieltjes integrals if    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is the (Lebesgue) integral of its derivative; in this case    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is said to be  absolutely continuous . ,  However,    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     may have jump discontinuities, or may have derivative zero  almost  everywhere while still being continuous and increasing (for example,    \\n \\n \\n \\n g \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     could be the  Cantor function  or  Devil\\'s staircase ), in either of which cases the Riemann–Stieltjes integral is not captured by any expression involving derivatives of  g . ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral admits  integration by parts  in the form ,  and the existence of either integral implies the existence of the other ( Hille &amp; Phillips 1974 , §3.3). ,  The best simple existence theorem states that if  f  is continuous and  g  is of  bounded variation  on [ a ,  b ], then the integral exists.  [2]   A function  g  is of bounded variation if and only if it is the difference between two monotone functions. If  g  is not of bounded variation, then there will be continuous functions which cannot be integrated with respect to  g . In general, the integral is not well-defined if  f  and  g  share any points of  discontinuity , but this sufficient condition is not necessary. ,  On the other hand, a classical result of  Young (1936)  states that the integral is well-defined if  f  is  α - Hölder continuous  and  g  is  β -Hölder continuous with  α  +  β  &gt; 1. ,  If  g  is the  cumulative probability distribution function  of a  random variable   X  that has a  probability density function  with respect to  Lebesgue measure , and  f  is any function for which the  expected value  E(| f ( X )|) is finite [   clarification needed   ] , then the probability density function of  X  is the derivative of  g  and we have ,  But this formula does not work if  X  does not have a probability density function with respect to Lebesgue measure. In particular, it does not work if the distribution of  X  is discrete (i.e., all of the probability is accounted for by point-masses), and even if the cumulative distribution function  g  is continuous, it does not work if  g  fails to be  absolutely continuous  (again, the  Cantor function  may serve as an example of this failure). But the identity ,  holds if  g  is  any  cumulative probability distribution function on the real line, no matter how ill-behaved. In particular, no matter how ill-behaved the cumulative distribution function  g  of a random variable  X , if the  moment  E( X   n  ) exists, then it is equal to ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral appears in the original formulation of F. Riesz\\'s theorem which represents the  dual space  of the  Banach space   C [ a , b ] of continuous functions in an interval [ a , b ] as Riemann–Stieltjes integrals against functions of  bounded variation . Later, that theorem was reformulated in terms of measures. ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral also appears in the formulation of the  spectral theorem  for (non-compact) self-adjoint (or more generally, normal) operators in a Hilbert space. In this theorem, the integral is considered with respect to a spectral family of projections. See  Riesz &amp; Sz. Nagy (1955)  for details. ,  An important generalization is the  Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral  which generalizes the Riemann–Stieltjes integral in a way analogous to how the  Lebesgue integral  generalizes the Riemann integral. If  improper  Riemann–Stieltjes integrals are allowed, the Lebesgue integral is not strictly more general than the Riemann–Stieltjes integral. ,  The Riemann–Stieltjes integral also generalizes to the case when either the integrand  ƒ  or the integrator  g  take values in a  Banach space . If   g \\xa0: [ a , b ] →  X   takes values in the Banach space  X , then it is natural to assume that it is of  strongly bounded variation , meaning that ,  the supremum being taken over all finite partitions ,  of the interval [ a , b ]. This generalization plays a role in the study of  semigroups , via the  Laplace–Stieltjes transform . ]',\n",
       " '[ The  derivative  of a  function of a real variable  measures the sensitivity to change of the function (output) value with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of  calculus . For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to  time  is the object\\'s  velocity : this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. ,  The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the  slope  of the  tangent line  to the  graph of the function  at that point. The tangent line is the best  linear approximation  of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. ,  Derivatives may be generalized to  functions of several real variables . In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a  linear transformation  whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The  Jacobian matrix  is the  matrix  that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the  partial derivatives  with respect to the independent variables. For a  real-valued function  of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the  gradient vector . ,  The process of finding a derivative is called  differentiation . The reverse process is called   antidifferentiation  . The  fundamental theorem of calculus  states that antidifferentiation is the same as  integration . Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.  [Note 1]   ,   ,   ,   Differentiation  is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a  function    y  =  f ( x )  of a variable   x   is a measure of the rate at which the value   y   of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable   x  . It is called the  derivative  of   f   with respect to   x  . If   x   and   y   are  real numbers , and if the  graph  of   f   is plotted against   x  , the derivative is the  slope  of this graph at each point. ,  The simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a  constant function , is when   y   is a  linear function  of   x  , meaning that the graph of   y   is a line. In this case,   y  =  f ( x ) =  m   x  +  b  , for real numbers   m   and   b  , and the slope   m   is given by ,  where the symbol  Δ  ( Delta ) is an abbreviation for \"change in.\" This formula is true because ,  Thus, since ,  it follows that ,  This gives an exact value for the slope of a line. If the function   f   is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), however, then the change in   y   divided by the change in   x   varies: differentiation is a method to find an exact value for this rate of change at any given value of   x  . ,  The idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the  limit value  of the  ratio of the differences   Δ y  / Δ x   as  Δ x   becomes infinitely small. ,  Two distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from  Leibniz  and the other from  Joseph Louis Lagrange . ,  In  Leibniz\\'s notation , an  infinitesimal  change in   x   is denoted by   dx  , and the derivative of   y   with respect to   x   is written ,  suggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities. (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of  y  with respect to  x \", \"d y by d x\", or \"d y over d x\". The oral form \"d y d x\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.) ,  In  Lagrange\\'s notation , the derivative with respect to   x   of a function   f ( x )  is denoted   f \\'  ( x )  (read as \"f prime of x\") or   f x   \\' ( x )  (read as \"f prime x of x\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the derivation. Lagrange\\'s notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to  Newton . ,  The most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a  limit  of difference quotients of real numbers.  [1]   This is the approach described below. ,  Let   f   be a real valued function defined in an  open neighborhood  of a real number   a  . In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function   f   at   a   was the unique line through the point  ( a ,  f ( a ))  that did  not  meet the graph of   f    transversally , meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph. The derivative of   y   with respect to   x   at   a   is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of   f   at  ( a ,  f ( a )) . The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through  ( a ,  f ( a ))  and a nearby point on the graph, for example  ( a  +  h ,  f ( a  +  h )) . These lines are called  secant lines . A value of   h   close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in  absolute value ) of   h   will, in general, give better  approximations . The slope   m   of the secant line is the difference between the   y   values of these points divided by the difference between the   x   values, that is, ,  This expression is  Newton \\'s  difference quotient . Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a  limit . Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line. Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as   h   approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to  ( a ,  f ( a )) . This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function   f   at   a  : ,  When the limit exists,   f   is said to be   differentiable   at   a  . Here   f ′ ( a )  is one of several common notations for the derivative ( see below ). ,  Equivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that ,  which has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to   f   at   a   gives the  best  linear  approximation  ,  to   f   near   a   (i.e., for small   h  ). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ( see below ). ,   Substituting  0 for   h   in the difference quotient causes  division by zero , so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method. Instead, define   Q ( h )  to be the difference quotient as a function of   h  : ,    Q ( h )  is the slope of the secant line between  ( a ,  f ( a ))  and  ( a  +  h ,  f ( a  +  h )) . If   f   is a  continuous function , meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then   Q   is a continuous function away from   h  = 0 . If the limit  lim  h →0  Q ( h )  exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for   Q (0)  that makes   Q   a continuous function, then the function   f   is differentiable at   a  , and its derivative at   a   equals   Q (0) . ,  In practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient   Q ( h )  to   h  = 0  is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel   h   in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of   Q   for small   h   clear even though   Q   is still not defined at   h  = 0 . This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process. ,  Relative to a  hyperreal  extension   R  ⊂  R  *   of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function   y  =  f(x)   at a real point   x   can be defined as the  shadow  of the quotient    ∆ y   /  ∆ x     for  infinitesimal   ∆ x  , where  ∆ y  =  f ( x + ∆ x ) -  f ( x ) . Here the natural extension of   f   to the hyperreals is still denoted   f  . Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen. ,  The squaring function   f ( x ) =  x  2   is differentiable at   x  = 3 , and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as   h   approaches zero of the difference quotient of   f (3) : ,  The last expression shows that the difference quotient equals   6  +  h   when   h  ≠ 0  and is undefined when   h  = 0 , because of the definition of the difference quotient. However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when   h  = 0 . The limit is the result of letting   h   go to zero, meaning it is the value that  6 +  h   tends to as   h   becomes very small: ,  Hence the slope of the graph of the squaring function at the point  (3, 9)  is 6, and so its derivative at   x  = 3  is   f ′(3) = 6 . ,  More generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the squaring function at   x  =  a   is   f ′( a ) = 2 a  : ,  If   y  =  f ( x )  is  differentiable  at   a  , then   f   must also be  continuous  at   a  . As an example, choose a point   a   and let   f   be the  step function  that returns a value, say 1, for all   x   less than   a  , and returns a different value, say 10, for all   x   greater than or equal to   a  .   f   cannot have a derivative at   a  . If   h   is negative, then   a  +  h   is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from   a   to   a  +  h   is very steep, and as   h   tends to zero the slope tends to infinity. If   h   is positive, then   a  +  h   is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from   a   to   a  +  h   has slope zero. Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.  [Note 2]   ,  However, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there. For example, the  absolute value  function   y  = |  x  |  is continuous at   x  = 0 , but it is not differentiable there. If   h   is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to   h   is one, whereas if   h   is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to   h   is negative one. This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at   x  = 0 . Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its  tangent is vertical : For instance, the function   y  =  x  1/3   is not differentiable at   x  = 0 . ,  In summary: for a function   f   to have a derivative it is   necessary   for the function   f   to be continuous, but continuity alone is not   sufficient  . ,  Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at  almost every  point. Early in the  history of calculus , many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a  monotone function  or a  Lipschitz function , this is true. However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. This example is now known as the  Weierstrass function . In 1931,  Stefan Banach  proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a  meager set  in the space of all continuous functions.  [2]   Informally, this means that hardly any continuous functions have a derivative at even one point. ,  Let   f   be a function that has a derivative at every point   a   in the  domain  of   f  . Because every point   a   has a derivative, there is a function that sends the point   a   to the derivative of   f   at   a  . This function is written   f  ′( x )  and is called the  derivative function  or the  derivative  of   f  . The derivative of   f   collects all the derivatives of   f   at all the points in the domain of   f  . ,  Sometimes   f   has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain. The function whose value at   a   equals   f  ′( a )  whenever   f  ′( a )  is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of   f  . It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of   f  . ,  Using this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an  operator  whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions. If we denote this operator by   D  , then   D ( f )  is the function   f  ′( x ) . Since   D ( f )  is a function, it can be evaluated at a point   a  . By the definition of the derivative function,   D ( f )( a ) =  f  ′( a ) . ,  For comparison, consider the doubling function   f ( x ) = 2 x  ;   f   is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs: ,  The operator   D  , however, is not defined on individual numbers. It is only defined on functions: ,  Because the output of   D   is a function, the output of   D   can be evaluated at a point. For instance, when   D   is applied to the squaring function,   x  ↦  x  2  ,   D   outputs the doubling function   x  ↦ 2 x  , which we named   f ( x ) . This output function can then be evaluated to get   f (1) = 2 ,   f (2) = 4 , and so on. ,  Let   f   be a differentiable function, and let   f  ′( x )  be its derivative. The derivative of   f  ′( x )  (if it has one) is written   f  ′′( x )  and is called the   second derivative  of  f  . Similarly, the derivative of a second derivative, if it exists, is written   f  ′′′( x )  and is called the   third derivative  of  f  . Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the   n  th derivative as the derivative of the  ( n -1) th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called  higher-order derivatives . The   n  th derivative is also called the  derivative of order   n   . ,  If   x ( t )  represents the position of an object at time   t  , then the higher-order derivatives of   x   have physical interpretations. The second derivative of   x   is the derivative of   x ′( t ) , the velocity, and by definition this is the object\\'s  acceleration . The third derivative of   x   is defined to be the  jerk , and the fourth derivative is defined to be the  jounce . ,  A function   f   need not have a derivative, for example, if it is not continuous. Similarly, even if   f   does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative. For example, let ,  Calculation shows that   f   is a differentiable function whose derivative is ,    f ′(x)   is twice the absolute value function, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have   k   derivatives for any non-negative integer   k   but no  ( k  + 1) th-order derivative. A function that has   k   successive derivatives is called   k  times differentiable . If in addition the   k  th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of  differentiability class    C k   . (This is a stronger condition than having   k   derivatives. For an example, see  differentiability class .) A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called  infinitely differentiable  or   smooth  . ,  On the real line, every  polynomial function  is infinitely differentiable. By standard  differentiation rules , if a polynomial of degree   n   is differentiated   n   times, then it becomes a  constant function . All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero. In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions. ,  The derivatives of a function   f   at a point   x   provide polynomial approximations to that function near   x  . For example, if   f   is twice differentiable, then ,  in the sense that ,  If   f   is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the  Taylor series  for   f   evaluated at   x  +  h   around   x  . ,  A point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an  inflection point .  [3]   At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point   x  = 0  of the function   y  =  x  3  , or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point   x  = 0  of the function   y  =  x  1/3  . At an inflection point, a function switches from being a  convex function  to being a  concave function  or vice versa. ,  The symbols dx, dy, and dx/dy were introduced by  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  in 1675.   [4]   It is still commonly used when the equation   y  =  f ( x )  is viewed as a functional relationship between  dependent and independent variables . Then the first derivative is denoted by ,  and was once thought of as an  infinitesimal  quotient. Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation ,  for the  n th derivative of   y  =  f ( x )  (with respect to  x ). These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example, ,  With Leibniz\\'s notation, we can write the derivative of  y  at the point   x  =  a   in two different ways: ,  Leibniz\\'s notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially relevant for  partial differentiation . It also makes the  chain rule  easy to remember:  [Note 3]   ,  Sometimes referred to as  prime notation ,  [5]   one of the most common modern notation for differentiation is due to  Joseph-Louis Lagrange  and uses the  prime mark , so that the derivative of a function  f ( x ) is denoted  f ′( x ) or simply  f ′. Similarly, the second and third derivatives are denoted ,  To denote the number of derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in  superscript , whereas others place the number in parentheses: ,  The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation  f   ( n )  for the  n th derivative of  f  – this notation is most useful when we wish to talk about the derivative as being a function itself, as in this case the Leibniz notation can become cumbersome. ,   Newton\\'s notation  for differentiation, also called the dot notation, places a dot over the function name to represent a time derivative. If   y  =  f ( t ) , then ,  denote, respectively, the first and second derivatives of  y  with respect to  t . This notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or  arc length . It is very common in  physics ,  differential equations , and  differential geometry .  [6]    [7]   While the notation becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives, in practice only few derivatives are needed. ,   Euler \\'s notation uses a  differential operator   D , which is applied to a function  f  to give the first derivative  Df . The second derivative is denoted  D  2  f , and the  n th derivative is denoted  D   n   f . ,  If   y  =  f ( x )  is a dependent variable, then often the subscript  x  is attached to the  D  to clarify the independent variable  x . Euler\\'s notation is then written ,  although this subscript is often omitted when the variable  x  is understood, for instance when this is the only variable present in the expression. ,  Euler\\'s notation is useful for stating and solving  linear differential equations . ,  The derivative of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using  rules  for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones. ,  Most derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions. The following incomplete list gives some of the most frequently used functions of a single real variable and their derivatives. ,  where  r  is any  real number , then ,  wherever this function is defined. For example, if    \\n \\n \\n \\n f \\n ( \\n x \\n ) \\n = \\n \\n x \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n / \\n \\n 4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  } \\n \\n    , then ,  and the derivative function is defined only for positive  x , not for   x  = 0 . When   r  = 0 , this rule implies that  f ′( x ) is zero for   x  ≠ 0 , which is almost the constant rule (stated below). ,  In many cases, complicated limit calculations by direct application of Newton\\'s difference quotient can be avoided using differentiation rules. Some of the most basic rules are the following. ,  The derivative of ,  is ,  Here the second term was computed using the  chain rule  and third using the  product rule . The known derivatives of the elementary functions  x  2 ,  x  4 , sin( x ), ln( x ) and  exp( x ) =  e   x   , as well as the constant 7, were also used. ,  A  vector-valued function   y ( t ) of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some  vector space   R   n  . A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions  y  1 ( t ),  y  2 ( t ), …,  y   n  ( t ), meaning that   y ( t ) = ( y  1 ( t ), ...,  y   n  ( t )) . This includes, for example,  parametric curves  in  R  2  or  R  3 . The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them. The derivative of  y ( t ) is defined to be the  vector , called the  tangent vector , whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions. That is, ,  Equivalently, ,  if the limit exists. The subtraction in the numerator is subtraction of vectors, not scalars. If the derivative of  y  exists for every value of  t , then  y ′ is another vector valued function. ,  If  e  1 , …,  e   n   is the standard basis for  R   n  , then  y ( t ) can also be written as   y  1 ( t ) e  1  + … +  y   n  ( t ) e   n   . If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the  linearity  property, then the derivative of  y ( t ) must be ,  because each of the basis vectors is a constant. ,  This generalization is useful, for example, if  y ( t ) is the position vector of a particle at time  t ; then the derivative  y ′( t ) is the  velocity  vector of the particle at time  t . ,  Suppose that  f  is a function that depends on more than one variable—for instance, ,   f  can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables: ,  In other words, every value of  x  chooses a function, denoted  f x  , which is a function of one real number.  [Note 4]   That is, ,  Once a value of  x  is chosen, say  a , then   f ( x ,  y )  determines a function  f a   that sends  y  to   a  2  + ay +  y  2  : ,  In this expression,  a  is a  constant , not a  variable , so  f a   is a function of only one real variable. Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies: ,  The above procedure can be performed for any choice of  a . Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of  f  in the  y  direction: ,  This is the partial derivative of  f  with respect to  y . Here  ∂  is a rounded  d  called the  partial derivative symbol . To distinguish it from the letter  d , ∂ is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\". ,  In general, the  partial derivative  of a function   f ( x  1 , …,  x   n  )  in the direction  x i   at the point ( a  1  …,  a   n  ) is defined to be: ,  In the above difference quotient, all the variables except  x i   are held fixed. That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable ,  and, by definition, ,  In other words, the different choices of  a  index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above. This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives. ,  An important example of a function of several variables is the case of a  scalar-valued function    f ( x  1 , ...,  x   n  )  on a domain in Euclidean space  R   n   (e.g., on  R  2  or  R  3 ). In this case  f  has a partial derivative ∂ f /∂ x   j   with respect to each variable  x   j  . At the point  a , these partial derivatives define the vector ,  This vector is called the   gradient   of  f  at  a . If  f  is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function ∇ f  that takes the point  a  to the vector ∇ f ( a ). Consequently, the gradient determines a  vector field . ,  If  f  is a real-valued function on  R  n , then the partial derivatives of  f  measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes. For example, if  f  is a function of  x  and  y , then its partial derivatives measure the variation in  f  in the  x  direction and the  y  direction. They do not, however, directly measure the variation of  f  in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line   y  =  x  . These are measured using directional derivatives. Choose a vector ,  The  directional derivative  of  f  in the direction of  v  at the point  x  is the limit ,  In some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector. Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector. To see how this works, suppose that   v  = λ u  . Substitute   h  =  k /λ  into the difference quotient. The difference quotient becomes: ,  This is λ times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of  f  with respect to  u . Furthermore, taking the limit as  h  tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as  k  tends to zero because  h  and  k  are multiples of each other. Therefore,   D   v  ( f ) = λ D   u  ( f ) . Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors. ,  If all the partial derivatives of  f  exist and are continuous at  x , then they determine the directional derivative of  f  in the direction  v  by the formula: ,  This is a consequence of the definition of the  total derivative . It follows that the directional derivative is  linear  in  v , meaning that   D   v  +  w  ( f ) =  D   v  ( f ) +  D   w  ( f ) . ,  The same definition also works when  f  is a function with values in  R  m . The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors. In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in  R  m . ,  When  f  is a function from an open subset of  R   n   to  R   m  , then the directional derivative of  f  in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to  f  at that point and in that direction. But when   n  &gt; 1 , no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of  f . The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once. That is, for any vector  v  starting at  a , the linear approximation formula holds: ,  Just like the single-variable derivative,   f \\u2009′( a )  is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible. ,  If  n  and  m  are both one, then the derivative   f \\u2009′( a )  is a number and the expression   f \\u2009′( a ) v   is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for   f \\u2009′( a )  to be a number. If it were a number, then   f \\u2009′( a ) v   would be a vector in  R   n   while the other terms would be vectors in  R   m  , and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense,   f \\u2009′( a )  must be a function that sends vectors in  R   n   to vectors in  R   m  , and   f \\u2009′( a ) v   must denote this function evaluated at  v . ,  To determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as ,  Notice that if we choose another vector  w , then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting  w  for  v . It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both  w  for  v  and   a  +  v   for  a . By subtracting these two new equations, we get ,  If we assume that  v  is small and that the derivative varies continuously in  a , then   f \\u2009′( a  +  v )  is approximately equal to   f \\u2009′( a ) , and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with   v  +  w   substituted for  v . The linear approximation formula implies: ,  This suggests that   f \\u2009′( a )  is a  linear transformation  from the vector space  R   n   to the vector space  R   m  . In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations. Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times || v ||, where the constant is independent of  v  but depends continuously on  a . Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities. In particular,   f \\u2009′( a )  is a linear transformation up to a small error term. In the limit as  v  and  w  tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as  v  goes to zero,   f \\u2009′( a )  must be a linear transformation. ,  In one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients. However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain  R   m   while the denominator lies in the domain  R   n  . Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator. To make precise the idea that   f \\u2009′( a )  is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If   f \\xa0:  R  →  R  , then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of  f  at  a  is the unique number   f \\u2009′( a )  such that ,  This is equivalent to ,  because the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero. This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with  norms . ,  The definition of the  total derivative  of  f  at  a , therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation   f \\u2009′( a )\\xa0:  R   n   →  R   m    such that ,  Here  h  is a vector in  R   n  , so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on  R   n  . However,  f ′( a ) h  is a vector in  R   m  , and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on  R   m  . If  v  is a vector starting at  a , then   f \\u2009′( a ) v   is called the  pushforward  of  v  by  f  and is sometimes written   f  ∗  v  . ,  If the total derivative exists at  a , then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of  f  exist at  a , and for all  v ,   f \\u2009′( a ) v   is the directional derivative of  f  in the direction  v . If we write  f  using coordinate functions, so that   f  = ( f  1 ,  f  2 , ...,  f   m  ) , then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a  matrix . This matrix is called the   Jacobian matrix   of  f  at  a : ,  The existence of the total derivative  f ′( a ) is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on  a . ,  The definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable. That is, if  f  is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists. The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1×1 matrix whose only entry is the derivative  f ′( x ). This 1×1 matrix satisfies the property that   f ( a  +  h ) −  f ( a ) −  f \\u2009′( a ) h   is approximately zero, in other words that ,  Up to changing variables, this is the statement that the function    \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n ↦  \\n f \\n ( \\n a \\n ) \\n + \\n \\n f \\n ′ \\n \\n ( \\n a \\n ) \\n ( \\n x \\n −  \\n a \\n ) \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is the best linear approximation to  f  at  a . ,  The total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case. This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function. Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the  tangent bundle  of the source to the tangent bundle of the target. ,  The natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a  jet , cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors. It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the  jet bundle . The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the  k th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to  k . ,  By repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the  Fréchet derivative , specialized to  R   p  . The  k th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map ,  which takes a point  x  in  R  n  and assigns to it an element of the space of  k -linear maps from  R  n  to  R  m  – the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense)  k -linear approximation to  f  at that point. By precomposing it with the  diagonal map  Δ,   x  → ( x ,  x ) , a generalized Taylor series may be begun as ,  where f( a ) is identified with a constant function,   x   i   −  a   i    are the components of the vector   x  −  a  , and  ( Df )  i    and  ( D  2  f )  jk    are the components of   Df   and   D  2  f   as linear transformations. ,  The concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a  linear approximation  of the function at that point. ]',\n",

[1]   If such a limit exists, the sequence is called  convergent . A sequence which does not converge is said to be  divergent .  [2]   The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of  analysis  ultimately rests.  [1]   ,  Limits can be defined in any  metric  or  topological space , but are usually first encountered in the  real numbers . ,   ,   ,  The Greek philosopher  Zeno of Elea  is famous for formulating  paradoxes that involve limiting processes . ,   Leucippus ,  Democritus ,  Antiphon ,  Eudoxus  and  Archimedes  developed the  method of exhaustion , which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a  geometric series . ,   Newton  dealt with series in his works on  Analysis with infinite series  (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711),  Method of fluxions and infinite series  (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and  Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum  (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his  Optiks ). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of ( x + o )  n   which he then linearizes by  taking limits  (letting  o →0). ,  In the 18th century,  mathematicians  such as  Euler  succeeded in summing some  divergent  series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century,  Lagrange  in his  Théorie des fonctions analytiques  (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus.  Gauss  in his etude of  hypergeometric series  (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit. ,  The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index  N  so that ...) was given by  Bernhard Bolzano  ( Der binomische Lehrsatz , Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by  Karl Weierstrass  in the 1870s. ,  In the  real numbers , a number    \\n \\n \\n \\n L \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is the  limit  of the  sequence     \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n  )} \\n \\n     if the numbers in the sequence become closer and closer to    \\n \\n \\n \\n L \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     and not to any other number. ,  We call    \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     the  limit  of the  sequence     \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n  )} \\n \\n     if the following condition holds: ,  In other words, for every measure of closeness    \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    , the sequence\\'s terms are eventually that close to the limit. The sequence    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n  )} \\n \\n     is said to  converge to  or  tend to  the limit    \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    , written    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n →  \\n x \\n \\n \\n  \\\\to x} \\n \\n     or    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n lim \\n \\n n \\n →  \\n ∞  \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n = \\n x \\n \\n \\n  x_ =x} \\n \\n    . ,  Symbolically, this is: ,  If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is  convergent ; otherwise it is  divergent . ,  Example of a sequence which converges to the limit    \\n \\n \\n \\n a \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    . ,  Regardless which    \\n \\n \\n \\n ε  \\n &gt; \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     we have, there is an index    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  } \\n \\n    , so that the sequence lies afterwards completely in the epsilon tube    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n a \\n −  \\n ε  \\n , \\n a \\n + \\n ε  \\n ) \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    . ,  There is also for a smaller    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n &gt; \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n  &gt;0} \\n \\n     an index    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  } \\n \\n    , so that the sequence is afterwards inside the epsilon tube    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n a \\n −  \\n \\n ε  \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n , \\n a \\n + \\n \\n ε  \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n  ,a+\\\\varepsilon _ )} \\n \\n    . ,  For each    \\n \\n \\n \\n ε  \\n &gt; \\n 0 \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     there are only finitely many sequence members outside the epsilon tube. ,  Limits of sequences behave well with respect to the usual  arithmetic operations .

In fact, any real-valued  function   f  is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences (though this is not necessarily true when using more general notions of continuity). ,  Some other important properties of limits of real sequences include the following (provided, in each equation below, that the limits on the right exist). ,  These properties are extensively used to prove limits without the need to directly use the cumbersome formal definition.

If a sequence tends to infinity, or to minus infinity, then it is divergent (however, a divergent sequence need not tend to plus or minus infinity: take for example    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n = \\n ( \\n −  \\n 1 \\n \\n ) \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  =(-1)^ } \\n \\n    ). ,  A point  x  of the  metric space  ( X ,  d ) is the  limit  of the  sequence  ( x n  ) if, for all ε &gt; 0, there is an  N  such that, for every    \\n \\n \\n \\n n \\n ≥  \\n N \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    ,    \\n \\n \\n \\n d \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n , \\n x \\n ) \\n &lt; \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n  ,x)&lt;\\\\epsilon } \\n \\n    .

In fact, a  function   f  is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences. ,  Limits of sequences are unique when they exist, as distinct points are separated by some positive distance, so for    \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     less than half this distance, sequence terms cannot be within a distance    \\n \\n \\n \\n ϵ  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     of both points. ,  A point  x  of the topological space ( X , τ) is the  limit  of the  sequence  ( x n  ) if, for every  neighbourhood   U  of  x , there is an  N  such that, for every    \\n \\n \\n \\n n \\n ≥  \\n N \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    ,    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ∈  \\n U \\n \\n \\n  \\\\in U} \\n \\n    . This coincides with the definition given for metric spaces if ( X , d ) is a metric space and    \\n \\n \\n \\n τ  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     is the topology generated by  d . ,  The limit of a sequence of points    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n : \\n n \\n ∈  \\n \\n N \\n \\n ) \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  :n\\\\in \\\\mathbb   \\\\right)\\\\;} \\n \\n     in a topological space  T  is a special case of the  limit of a function : the domain is    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n \\n \\n   } \\n \\n     in the space    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n ∪  \\n { \\n + \\n ∞  \\n } \\n \\n \\n   \\\\cup \\\\lbrace +\\\\infty \\\\rbrace } \\n \\n     with the  induced topology  of the  affinely extended real number system , the range is  T , and the function argument  n  tends to +∞, which in this space is a  limit point  of    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n N \\n \\n \\n \\n   } \\n \\n    . ,  If  X  is a  Hausdorff space  then limits of sequences are unique where they exist. Note that this need not be the case in general; in particular, if two points  x  and  y  are  topologically indistinguishable , any sequence that converges to  x  must converge to  y  and vice versa. ,  A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms ultimately become arbitrarily close together, after sufficiently many initial terms have been discarded. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in  metric spaces , and, in particular, in  real analysis . One particularly important result in real analysis is the  Cauchy criterion for convergence of sequences : A sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. This remains true in other  complete metric spaces . ,  The definition of the limit using the  hyperreal numbers  formalizes the intuition that for a \"very large\" value of the index, the corresponding term is \"very close\" to the limit. More precisely, a real sequence    \\n \\n \\n \\n ( \\n \\n x \\n \\n n \\n \\n \\n ) \\n \\n \\n  )} \\n \\n     tends to  L  if for every infinite  hypernatural   H , the term  x   H   is infinitely close to  L , i.e., the difference  x   H   -  L  is  infinitesimal . Equivalently,  L  is the  standard part  of  x   H   ,  Thus, the limit can be defined by the formula ,  where the limit exists if and only if the righthand side is independent of the choice of an infinite  H . ]',\n",
       " '[  Edvard Munch  (   /  m  ʊ  ŋ  k  /   ;  [1]    Norwegian:\\xa0   [ˈɛdvɑʈ muŋk]   \\xa0  (   listen )  ; 12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a  Norwegian   painter  and  printmaker  whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main tenets of late 19th-century  Symbolism  and greatly influenced  German Expressionism  in the early 20th century. One of his best known works is   The Scream   of 1893. ,   ,   ,  Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of  Ådalsbruk  in  Løten ,  United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway , to Laura Catherine Bjølstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Both Sophie and Edvard appear to have inherited their artistic talent from their mother. Edvard Munch was related to painter  Jacob Munch  and historian  Peter Andreas Munch .  [2]   ,  The family moved to Christiania (renamed Kristiania in 1877, and now  Oslo ) in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at  Akershus Fortress . Edvard\\'s mother died of  tuberculosis  in 1868, as did Munch\\'s favorite sister Johanne Sophie in 1877.  [3]   After their mother\\'s death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer  Edgar Allan Poe .  [4]   ,  As Edvard remembered it, Christian\\'s positive behavior toward his children was overshadowed by his morbid  pietism . Munch wrote, \"My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born.\"  [5]   Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard\\'s poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him.  [6]   One of Munch\\'s younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding. Munch would later write, \"I inherited two of mankind\\'s most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity.\"  [7]   ,  Christian Munch\\'s military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty.  [3]   They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munch\\'s early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munch\\'s interests.  [8]   At thirteen, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.  [9]   ,  In 1879, Munch enrolled in a  technical college  to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and math. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies.  [10]   The following year, much to his father\\'s disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an \"unholy trade\", and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters.  [11]   In contrast to his father\\'s rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art. He wrote his goal in his diary: \"in my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself.\"  [10]   ,  In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were sculptor  Julius Middelthun  and the  naturalistic  painter  Christian Krohg .  [12]   That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the Academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students.  [13]   His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic\\'s dismissive response: \"It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art.\"  [14]   Munch\\'s nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for  Standing Nude  (1887). They may have been confiscated by his father.  [15]   ,  During these early years, Munch experimented with many styles, including  Naturalism  and  Impressionism . Some early works are reminiscent of  Manet . Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses.  [14]   At one point, however, Munch\\'s father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch\\'s cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.  [16]   ,  Munch also received his father\\'s ire for his relationship with  Hans Jæger , the local nihilist who lived by the code \"a passion to destroy is also a creative passion\" and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom.  [17]   Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. \"My ideas developed under the influence of the  bohemians  or rather under Hans Jæger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of  Strindberg  and the Germans…but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then.\"  [18]   At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called  The City of Free Love .  [19]   Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munch\\'s relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life. ,  After numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jæger\\'s commandment that Munch should \"write his life\", meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his \"soul\\'s diary\".  [20]   This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting   The Sick Child   (1886), based on his sister\\'s death, was his first \"soul painting\", his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another \"violent outburst of moral indignation\" from the community.  [21]   ,  Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him: ,  He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch\\'s pictures are as a rule \"not complete\", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.  [22]   ,  Munch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style.  [23]   His idiom continued to veer between  naturalistic , as seen in  Portrait of Hans Jæger , and  impressionistic , as in  Rue Lafayette . His   Inger On the Beach   (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come.  [24]   He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the  Post-Impressionists , what evolved was a subject matter which was  symbolist  in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter  Léon Bonnat .  [25]   ,  Munch seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that it \"will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!\"  [26]   ,  Munch\\'s younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior  Melancholy: Laura . Amanda O\\'Neill says of the work, \"In this heated claustrophobic scene Munch not only portrays Laura\\'s tragedy, but his own dread of the madness he might have inherited.\"  [27]   ,  Munch arrived in Paris during the festivities of the  Exposition Universelle (1889)  and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists. His picture  Morning  (1884) was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion.  [28]   He spent his mornings at Bonnat\\'s busy studio (which included live female models) and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums (where students were expected to make copies as a way of learning technique and observation).  [29]   Munch recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnat\\'s drawing lessons—\"It tires and bores me—it\\'s numbing\"—but enjoyed the master\\'s commentary during museum trips.  [30]    [31]   ,  Munch was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential:  Paul Gauguin ,  Vincent van Gogh , and  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec —all notable for how they used color to convey emotion.  [31]   Munch was particularly inspired by Gauguin\\'s \"reaction against realism\" and his credo that \"art was human work and not an imitation of Nature\", a belief earlier stated by  Whistler .  [32]   As one of his Berlin friends said later of Munch, \"he need not make his way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature. He carries his own Tahiti within him.\"  [33]   Influenced by Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist  Max Klinger , Munch experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of his works. In 1896 he created his first woodcuts—a medium that proved ideal to Munch\\'s symbolic imagery.  [34]   Together with his contemporary  Nikolai Astrup , Munch is considered an innovator of the woodcut medium in Norway.  [35]   ,  In December 1889 his father died, leaving Munch\\'s family destitute. He returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for his family from then on.  [36]   Christian\\'s death depressed him and he was plagued by suicidal thoughts: \"I live with the dead—my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my father…Kill yourself and then it\\'s over. Why live?\"  [37]   Munch\\'s paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which he experimented with the  pointillist  style of  Georges Seurat .  [38]   ,  By 1892, Munch formulated his characteristic, and original,  Synthetist   aesthetic , as seen in  Melancholy  (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element. Considered by the artist and journalist  Christian Krohg  as the first  Symbolist  painting by a Norwegian artist,  Melancholy  was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo.  [39]   In 1892,  Adelsteen Normann , on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition,  [40]   the society\\'s first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed \"The Munch Affair\"), and after one week the exhibition closed.  [40]   Munch was pleased with the \"great commotion\", and wrote in a letter: \"Never have I had such an amusing time—it\\'s incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.\"  [41]   ,  In Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual  August Strindberg , whom he painted in 1892. During his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would comprise his major work,  The Frieze of Life , first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings.  [42]   He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings.  [43]   Already, Munch was showing a reluctance to part with his paintings, which he termed his \"children\". ,  His other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style.  [44]   Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in  Ashes , the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munch\\'s figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage ( Death in the Sick-Room ), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in  The Scream , Munch\\'s men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. He wrote, \"No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.\"  [45]   ,   The Scream  exists in four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910). There are also several lithographs of  The Scream  (1895 and later). ,  The 1895 pastel sold at auction on 2 May 2012 for US$119,922,500, including commission.  [46]   It is the most colorful of the versions  [47]   and is distinctive for the downward-looking stance of one of its background figures. It is also the only version not held by a Norwegian museum. ,  The 1893 version (shown here) was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and recovered. The 1910 painting was stolen in 2004 from The Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage. ,   The Scream  is Munch\\'s most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.  [45]   Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis. ,  With this painting, Munch met his stated goal of \"the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self\".  [48]   Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: \"I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.\"  [49]   He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, \"for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, \\'The Scream?\\' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.\"  [50]   ,  In summing up the painting\\'s effects, author Martha Tedeschi has stated: \"  Whistler\\'s Mother  , Wood\\'s   American Gothic  , Leonardo da Vinci\\'s   Mona Lisa   and Edvard Munch\\'s  The Scream  have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.\"  [51]   ,  In December 1893,  Unter den Linden  in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munch\\'s work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled  Study for a Series: Love.  This began a cycle he later called the  Frieze of Life—A Poem about Life, Love and Death.  \"Frieze of Life\" motifs, such as  The Storm  and  Moonlight,  are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as  Rose and Amelie  and  Vampire . In  Death in the Sickroom , the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding  Anxiety ,  Ashes ,   Madonna   and  Women in Three Stages  (from innocence to old age).  [52]   ,  Around the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the \"Frieze\". He painted a number of pictures, several of them in larger format and to some extent featuring the  Art Nouveau  aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting  Metabolism  (1898), initially called  Adam and Eve . This work reveals Munch\\'s preoccupation with the \"fall of man\" and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as  The Empty Cross  and  Golgotha  (both c. 1900) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch\\'s pietistic upbringing. The entire  Frieze  was shown for the first time at the  secessionist  exhibition in Berlin in 1902.  [53]   ,  \"The Frieze of Life\" themes recur throughout Munch\\'s work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death.  [54]   These themes are expressed in paintings such as   The Sick Child   (1885),  Love and Pain  (retitled  Vampire ; 1893–94),  Ashes  (1894), and  The Bridge . The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see   Puberty   and  Love and Pain ) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see  Separation ,  Jealousy , and  Ashes ). ,  Munch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity.  [55]   These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist\\'s sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence.  [56]   Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as  Madonna ,  Hands  and  Puberty , and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series.  [57]   Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, \"My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity.\"  [58]   ,  While attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, \"With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.\"  [59]   One of his great supporters in Berlin was  Walther Rathenau , later the German  foreign minister , who strongly contributed to his success. ,  In 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his \"Frieze of Life\" themes. He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch\\'s  Self-Portrait With Skeleton Arm  (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by  Paul Klee .  [60]   Munch also produced multi-colored versions of \"The Sick Child\" which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of  Kiss  (1892)  [60]   Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch\\'s work \"violent and brutal\" but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance.  [61]   His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman\\'s cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of  Åsgårdstrand  in Norway. He dubbed this home the \"Happy House\" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years.  [62]   It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. \"To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here\". ,  In 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, \"A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance.\"  [62]   In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in \"The Frieze of Life\" series,  The Dance of Life  (1899).  [64]   Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: \"Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.\"  [65]   Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin.  [65]   His  Girls on the Jetty , created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations.  [57]   In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing \"a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval.\"  [66]   The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch\\'s work even though the public still found his work alien and strange. ,  The good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and  Max Linde . He described the turn of events in his diary, \"After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me.\"  [67]   However, despite this positive change, Munch\\'s self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings.  [68]   His paintings  Still Life (The Murderess)  and  The Death of Marat I , done in 1906-7, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.  [69]   ,  In 1903-4, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming  Fauvists , famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs.  [70]   After studying the sculpture of  Rodin , Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture.  [71]   During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition.  [72]   In 1906, he painted the screen for an  Ibsen  play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin\\'s  Deutsches Theater , in which the  Frieze of Life  was hung. The theatre\\'s director  Max Reinhardt  later sold it; it is now in the Berlin  Nationalgalerie .  [73]   After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.  [74]   ,  In the autumn of 1908, Munch\\'s anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute. As he later wrote, \"My condition was verging on madness—it was touch and go.\"  [75]   Subject to hallucinations and feelings of persecution, he entered the clinic of Dr. Daniel Jacobson. The  therapy  Munch received for the next eight months included diet and \"electrification\" (a treatment then fashionable for nervous conditions, not to be confused with  electroconvulsive therapy ).  [76]   Munch\\'s stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic. Further brightening his mood, the general public of Kristiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings. He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St. Olav \"for services in art\".  [77]   His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York.  [78]   ,  As part of his recovery, Dr. Jacobson advised Munch to only socialize with good friends and avoid  drinking in public . Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery.  [79]   He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.  [80]   ,  The outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, \"All my friends are German but it is France that I love.\"  [81]   In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement.  [82]   Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work.  [83]   Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the  Spanish Flu , the worldwide pandemic of that year.  [84]   ,  Munch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at  Skøyen , Oslo.  [85]   Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse \"Rousseau\" as a model.  [86]   Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings. He likely had sexual relations with some of them.  [87]   Munch occasionally left his home to paint murals on commission, including those done for the  Freia  chocolate factory.  [88]   ,  To the end of his life, Munch continued to paint unsparing self-portraits, adding to his self-searching cycle of his life and his unflinching series of takes on his emotional and physical states. In the 1930s and 1940s, the  Nazis  labeled Munch\\'s work \" degenerate art \" (along with that of  Picasso ,  Paul Klee ,  Matisse ,  Gauguin  and many other modern artists) and removed his 82 works from German museums.  [89]    Adolf Hitler  announced in 1937, \"For all we care, those prehistoric Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching.\"  [90]   ,  In 1940, the  Germans invaded Norway  and the Nazi party took over the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other eleven were never recovered), including  The Scream  and  The Sick Child , and they too were hidden from the Nazis.  [91]   ,  Munch died in his house at Ekely near Oslo on 23 January 1944, about a month after his 80th birthday. His Nazi-orchestrated funeral suggested to Norwegians that he was a Nazi sympathizer, a kind of appropriation of the independent artist.  [92]   The city of Oslo bought the Ekely estate from Munch\\'s heirs in 1946; his house was demolished in May 1960.  [93]   ,  From my rotting body, \\nflowers shall grow \\nand I am in them \\nand that is eternity. ,  When Munch died, his remaining works were bequeathed to the city of Oslo, which built the  Munch Museum  at  Tøyen  (it opened in 1963). The museum holds a collection of approximately 1,100 paintings, 4,500 drawings, and 18,000 prints, the broadest collection of his works in the world.  [95]   The Munch Museum serves as Munch\\'s official estate,  [95]   and has been active in responding to copyright infringements, as well as clearing copyright for the work, such as the appearance of Munch\\'s  The Scream  in a 2006  M&amp;M\\'s  advertising campaign.  [96]   The U.S. copyright representative for the Munch Museum and the Estate of Edvard Munch is the  Artists Rights Society .  [97]   ,  Munch\\'s art was highly personalized and he did little teaching. His \"private\" symbolism was far more personal than that of other Symbolist painters such as  Gustave Moreau  and  James Ensor . Munch was still highly influential, particularly with the  German Expressionists , who followed his philosophy, \"I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive result of Man\\'s urge to open his heart.\"  [45]   Many of his paintings, including  The Scream , have universal appeal in addition to their highly personal meaning. ,  Munch\\'s works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. His cabin, \"the Happy House\", was given to the municipality of Åsgårdstrand in 1944; it serves as a small Munch Museum. The inventory has been maintained exactly as he left it. ,  One version of  The Scream  was stolen from the National Gallery in 1994. In 2004, another version of  The Scream , along with one of  Madonna , were stolen from the Munch Museum in a daring daylight robbery. All were eventually recovered, but the paintings stolen in the 2004 robbery were extensively damaged. They have been meticulously restored and are on display again. Three Munch works were stolen from the Hotel  Refsnes Gods  in 2005; they were shortly recovered, although one of the works was damaged during the robbery.  [98]   ,  In October 2006, the color  woodcut   Two people. The lonely  ( To mennesker. De ensomme ) set a new record for his prints when it was sold at an auction in Oslo for 8.1 million  NOK  (US$1.27 million). It also set a record for the highest price paid in auction in Norway.  [99]   On 3 November 2008, the painting  Vampire  set a new record for his paintings when it was sold for US$38.162 million at  Sotheby\\'s  New York. ,  Munch\\'s image appears on the Norwegian  1,000 kroner note , along with pictures inspired by his artwork.  [100]   ,  In February 2012, a major Munch exhibition,  Edvard Munch. The Modern Eye,  opened at the  Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt ; the exhibition was opened by  Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway .  [101]    [102]   ,  In May 2012,  The Scream  sold for $119.9 million, and is the  second most expensive artwork ever sold  at an open auction. (It was surpassed in November 2013 by   Three Studies of Lucian Freud  , which sold for $142.4 million).  [103]   ,  In 2013, four of Munch\\'s paintings were depicted in a series of stamps by the  Norwegian postal service , to commemorate the 150th anniversary of his birth in 2014.  [104]   ,  On 14 November 2016 a version of Munch\\'s The Girls on the Bridge sold for US$54.5 million at Sotheby\\'s, New York, making it the second highest price achieved for one of his paintings. [   citation needed   ]  ,  In 1911 the final competition for the decoration of the large walls of the University of Oslo Aula (assembly hall) was held between Munch and  Emanuel Vigeland . The episode is known as the  Aula Controversy . In 1914 Munch was finally commissioned to decorate the Aula and the work was completed in 1916. This major work in Norwegian monumental painting includes 11 paintings covering 223 m 2 .  The Sun ,  History  and  Alma Mater  are the key works in this sequence. Munch declared: “I wanted the decorations to form a complete and independent world of ideas, and I wanted their visual expression to be both distinctively Norwegian and universally human.” In 2014 it was suggested that the Aula paintings have a value of at least 500 million kroner.

       " '[  Vincent Willem van Gogh  ( Dutch:\\xa0   [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑn ˈɣɔx]   \\xa0(      \\xa0  listen   ) ;  [note 1]   30 March 1853\\xa0– 29\\xa0July 1890) was a Dutch  Post-Impressionist  painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860  oil paintings , most of them in the last two years of his life in  France , where he died. They include  landscapes ,  still lifes ,  portraits  and  self-portraits , and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive  brushwork  that contributed to the foundations of  modern art . His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. ,  Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a  Protestant  missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother  Theo  supported him financially, and the two kept up a  long correspondence by letter . His early works, mostly  still lifes  and depictions of  peasant labourers , contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the   avant-garde  , including  Émile Bernard  and  Paul Gauguin , who were reacting against the  Impressionist  sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and  local landscapes . His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in  Arles  in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include  olive trees , cypresses,  wheat fields  and  sunflowers . ,  Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at  Saint-Rémy . After he discharged himself and moved to the  Auberge Ravoux  in  Auvers-sur-Oise  near Paris, he came under the care of the  homeopathic  doctor  Paul Gachet . His depression continued and on 27\\xa0July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later. ,  Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\".  [6]   His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the  Fauves  and  German Expressionists . He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. ,   ,   ,  The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother,  Theo . Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent\\'s thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890.  [8]   Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.  [9]   ,  Theo kept all of Vincent\\'s letters to him;  [10]   Vincent kept few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo\\'s widow  Johanna  arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914.  [11]    [12]   Vincent\\'s letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\",  [9]   and read in parts like autobiography.  [9]   The translator  Arnold Pomerans  wrote that their publication adds a \"fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh\\'s artistic achievement, an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter\".  [13]   ,  There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister  Wil , 58 to the painter  Anthon van Rappard , 22 to  Émile Bernard  as well as individual letters to  Paul Signac ,  Paul Gauguin  and the critic  Albert Aurier . Some are illustrated with  sketches .  [9]   Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from Arles. While there Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French and English.  [14]   There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.  [15]   ,  Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in  Groot-Zundert , in the predominantly Catholic province of  North Brabant  in the southern Netherlands.  [16]   He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the  Dutch Reformed Church , and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth.  [note 2]   Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the  University of Leiden  in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).  [18]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s mother came from a prosperous family in  The Hague ,  [19]   and his father was the youngest son of a minister.  [20]   The two met when Anna\\'s younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus\\'s older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh\\'s parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert.  [21]   His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and  Willemina  (known as \"Wil\"). In later life Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo.  [22]   Van Gogh\\'s mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her.  [23]   Theodorus\\'s salary was modest, but the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family\\'s high social position.  [24]   ,  Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child.  [25]   He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860 was sent to the village school. In 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at  Zevenbergen ,  [26]   where he felt abandoned, and campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866 his parents sent him to the middle school in  Tilburg , where he was deeply unhappy.  [27]   His interest in art began at a young age; encouraged to draw as a child by his mother,  [28]   his early drawings are expressive,  [26]   but do not approach the intensity of his later work.  [29]   Constantijn C. Huysmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh\\'s profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect;  [30]   in March 1868 he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was \"austere and cold, and sterile\".  [31]   ,  In July 1869 Van Gogh\\'s uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers  Goupil &amp; Cie  in The Hague.  [32]   After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil\\'s London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at  87 Hackford Road ,  Stockwell .  [33]   This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo\\'s wife later remarked that this was the best year of his life. He became infatuated with his landlady\\'s daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.  [34]   ,  In April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small  boarding school  in  Ramsgate . When the proprietor moved to  Isleworth  in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him.  [35]    [36]   The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a  Methodist  minister\\'s assistant.  [37]   His parents had meanwhile moved to  Etten ;  [38]   in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in  Dordrecht . He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German.  [39]   He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic.  [40]   According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.  [41]   ,  To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877 the family sent him to live with his uncle  Johannes Stricker , a respected theologian, in Amsterdam.  [42]   Van Gogh prepared for the  University of Amsterdam  theology entrance examination;  [43]   he failed the exam, and left his uncle\\'s house in July 1878. He undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at a  Protestant  missionary school in  Laken , near Brussels.  [44]   ,  In January 1879 he took up a post as a missionary at  Petit-Wasmes .  [45]   in the coal-mining district of  Borinage  in Belgium. To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person, and moved to a small hut where he slept on straw.  [46]   His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for \"undermining the dignity of the priesthood\". He then walked the 75 kilometres (47\\xa0mi) to Brussels,  [47]   returned briefly to  Cuesmes  in the Borinage, but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880,  [note 3]   which caused concern and frustration for his parents. His father was especially frustrated and advised that his son should be committed to the lunatic asylum at  Geel .  [49]    [50]    [note 4]   ,  Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October.  [52]   He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo\\'s suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo\\'s recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist  Willem Roelofs , who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the  Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts . He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of  modelling  and  perspective .  [53]   ,  Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents.  [54]   He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia \"Kee\" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother\\'s older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than him, and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage.  [55]   She refused with the words \"No, nay, never\" (\" nooit, neen, nimmer \").  [56]   After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try and sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin,  Anton Mauve . Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be.  [57]   Mauve invited him to return in a few months, and suggested he spend the intervening time working in  charcoal  and  pastels ; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this advice.  [57]   ,  Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker, which he described to Theo as an attack.  [58]   Within days he left for Amsterdam.  [59]   Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his \"persistence is  disgusting \".  [60]   In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: \"Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame.\"  [60]    [61]   He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee\\'s father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh\\'s inability to support himself.  [62]   ,  Mauve took Van Gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas.  [63]   He quarreled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague.  [note 5]    [66]   Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from  plaster casts .  [67]   Van Gogh could only afford to hire people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved.  [68]   In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of  gonorrhoea  and spent three weeks in hospital.  [69]   Soon after, he first painted in oils,  [70]   bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were.  [71]   ,  By March 1882 Mauve appears to have gone cold towards Van Gogh, and stopped replying to his letters.  [72]   He had learned of Van Gogh\\'s new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute,  Clasina Maria \"Sien\" Hoornik  (1850–1904), and her young daughter.  [73]   Van Gogh had met Sien towards the end of January 1882, when she had a five-year-old daughter and was pregnant. She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this;  [74]   on 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem.  [75]   When Van Gogh\\'s father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him,  [76]   and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883 left Sien and the children.  [77]   ,  Poverty may have pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her daughter to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother.  [78]   Willem remembered visiting  Rotterdam  when he was about 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry in order to legitimise the child.  [79]   He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely.  [80]   Sien drowned herself in the  River Scheldt  in 1904.  [81]   ,  In September 1883 Van Gogh moved to  Drenthe  in the northern Netherlands. In December, driven by loneliness, he went to live with his parents, then in  Nuenen , North Brabant.  [81]   ,  In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and  paintings of weavers  and  their cottages .  [82]   From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour\\'s daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of  strychnine , but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital.  [75]   On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.  [83]   ,  Van Gogh painted several groups of  still lifes  in 1885.  [84]   During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.  [85]   ,  There was interest from a dealer in Paris early in 1885.  [86]   Theo asked Vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit.  [87]   In May, Van Gogh responded with his first major work,   The Potato Eaters  , and a series of \" peasant character studies \" which were the culmination of several years of work.  [88]   When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that they were too dark, and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism.  [85]   In August his work was publicly exhibited for the first time, in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague. One of his  young peasant sitters  became pregnant in September 1885; Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her, and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him.

Art Gallery of Ontario , Toronto ,  He moved to Antwerp that November, and rented a room above a paint dealer\\'s shop in the rue des Images ( Lange Beeldekensstraat ).  [91]   He lived in poverty and ate poorly, preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models. Bread, coffee and  tobacco  became his staple diet. In February 1886 he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful.  [92]   In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of  colour theory  and spent time in museums—particularly studying the work of  Peter Paul Rubens \\xa0– and broadened his palette to include  carmine ,  cobalt blue  and  emerald green . Van Gogh bought Japanese  ukiyo-e  woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings.  [93]   He was drinking heavily again,  [94]   and was hospitalised between February and March 1886,  [95]   when he was possibly also treated for  syphilis .  [96]    [note 6]   ,  After his recovery, and despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the  Academy of Fine Arts  in Antwerp, and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking.  [99]   He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with  Charles Verlat , the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class  Franz Vinck . Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by  Eugène Siberdt . Soon Siberdt and van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt\\'s requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When van Gogh was required to draw the  Venus of Milo  during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to van Gogh\\'s drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: \\'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like,  God damn it!  A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!\\' According to some accounts this was the last time van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris.  [100]   On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.  [101]   ,  Van Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo\\'s rue Laval apartment in  Montmartre , and studied at  Fernand Cormon \\'s studio. In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54  rue Lepic .  [102]   In Paris, Vincent painted  portraits of friends and acquaintances ,  still life paintings , views of  Le Moulin de la Galette ,  scenes in Montmartre ,  Asnières  and along the  Seine . In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at  Japonaiserie , tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine  Paris Illustre ,   The Courtesan or Oiran   (1887), after  Keisai Eisen , which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.  [103]   ,  After seeing the portrait of  Adolphe Monticelli  at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his   Seascape at Saintes-Maries   (1888).  [104]    [105]   Two years later, Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings, and Vincent bought some of Monticelli\\'s works to add to his collection.  [106]   ,  Van Gogh learned about  Fernand Cormon \\'s  atelier  from Theo.  [107]   He worked at the studio in April and May 1886,  [108]   where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist  John Peter Russell ,  [109]   and met fellow students  Émile Bernard ,  Louis Anquetin  and  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec \\xa0– who painted a portrait of him in pastel. They met at  Julien \"Père\" Tanguy \\'s paint shop,  [108]   (which was, at that time, the only place where  Paul Cézanne \\'s paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing  Pointillism  and  Neo-Impressionism  for the first time, and bringing attention to  Georges Seurat  and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.  [110]   ,  Conflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be \"almost unbearable\".  [108]   By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to  Asnières , a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of  complementary colours  – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts.  [87]    [108]   ,   Courtesan  (after  Eisen ), 1887.

In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris.  [111]   Towards the end of the year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris.  [112]   There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like  Camille Pissarro  and his son  Lucien , Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.  [113]   ,  Ill from drink and suffering from smoker\\'s cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.  [14]   He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an  art colony . The Danish artist  Christian Mourier-Petersen  became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The  Zouaves , the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"  [114]   ,  The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh\\'s more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours.  [115]   He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow,  ultramarine  and  mauve . His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including  The Old Mill  (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields.  [116]   This was one of seven canvases sent to  Pont-Aven  on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard,  Charles Laval  and others.  [116]   ,  The portrayals of the Arles landscape are informed by Van Gogh\\'s Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking  perspective , but excel in their use of colour.  [117]   His new-found appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work. In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded \"perspective frame\"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the  Société des Artistes Indépendants . In April, he was visited by the American artist  Dodge MacKnight , who was living nearby at  Fontvieille .  [118]    [119]   On 1 May 1888, for 15  francs  per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the  Yellow House  at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.  [120]   ,  On 7 May Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare,  [121]   having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and  Marie Ginoux . The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.  [122]   He wanted a gallery to display his work, and started a series of paintings that eventually included   Van Gogh\\'s Chair   (1888),   Bedroom in Arles   (1888),   The Night Café   (1888),   Café Terrace at Night   (September 1888),   Starry Night Over the Rhone   (1888), and   Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers   (1888), all intended for the  decoration for the Yellow House .  [123]   ,  Van Gogh wrote that with  The Night Café  he tried \"to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime\".  [124]   When he visited  Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer  in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant –  Paul-Eugène Milliet   [125]   – and painted  boats on the sea and the village .  [126]   MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to  Eugène Boch , a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.  [125]   ,   The Sower with Setting Sun , 1888.

While waiting, in August he painted   Sunflowers  . When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study  The Poet Against a Starry Sky.   [127]    [note 7]   ,  In preparation for Gauguin\\'s visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station\\'s postal supervisor  Joseph Roulin , whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House.  [129]   When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on the   Décoration for the Yellow House ,  probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook.  [130]   He completed two chair paintings:  Van Gogh\\'s Chair  and  Gauguin\\'s Chair.   [131]   ,  After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and in November the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his   The Painter of Sunflowers  ; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin\\'s suggestion. Among these \"imaginative\" paintings is   Memory of the Garden at Etten  .  [132]    [note 8]   Their first joint outdoor venture was at the  Alyscamps , when they produced the pendants   Les Alyscamps  .  [133]   The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was   Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers  .  [134]   ,  Van Gogh and Gauguin visited  Montpellier  in December 1888, where they saw works by  Courbet  and  Delacroix  in the  Musée Fabre .  [135]   Their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of \"excessive tension\", rapidly headed towards crisis point.

Gauguin claimed, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour.  [138]   Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially.  [139]   It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave.  [139]   The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House.  [140]   Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left the house for a walk, and \"rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand\".  [140]   This account is uncorroborated;  [141]   Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.  [140]   ,  After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh returned to his room, where he was assaulted by  voices  and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ),  [note 9]   causing severe bleeding.  [142]   He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented.  [142]   Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital,  [145]    [146]   where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed.  [140]   ,  Van Gogh had no recollection of the event, suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown.  [147]   The hospital diagnosis was \"acute mania with generalised delirium\",  [148]   and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care.  [149]    [150]   Gauguin immediately notified Theo, who on 24 December had proposed marriage to his old friend  Andries Bonger \\'s sister Johanna.  [151]   That evening Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles. He arrived on Christmas Day, comforted Vincent who seemed to be semi-lucid. That evening he left Arles for the return trip to Paris.  [152]   ,  During the first days of his treatment, Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to \"be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him.\"  [153]   Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.  [154]   ,  Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889.  [155]   He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and  delusions  of poisoning.  [156]   In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as \"le fou roux\" ( the redheaded madman );  [149]   Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March;  [157]   in April Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home.  [158]   Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in  Saint-Rémy-de-Provence . Around this time, he wrote, \"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\"  [159]   ,  Van Gogh gave his 1889  Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey  to Dr Rey. The physician was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop, then gave it away.  [160]   In 2016, the portrait was housed at the  Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts  and estimated to be worth over $50 million.

Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, less than 30 kilometres (19\\xa0mi) from Arles, and was run by a former naval doctor,  Théophile Peyron . Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which was to be used as a studio.  [162]   The clinic and  its garden  became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital\\'s interiors, such as  Vestibule of the Asylum  and  Saint-Rémy (September 1889) . Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as   The Starry Night  . He was allowed short supervised walks, which led to paintings of  cypresses  and olive trees, including   Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889,    Cypresses 1889,   Cornfield with Cypresses  (1889),  Country road in Provence by Night  (1890). In September 1889 he produced two further versions of  Bedroom in Arles .  [163]   ,  Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh was left to work on  interpretations of other artist\\'s paintings , such as  Millet \\'s  The Sower  and  Noonday Rest , as well as variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the  Realism  of  Jules Breton ,  Gustave Courbet  and Millet,  [164]   and he compared his copies to a musician\\'s interpreting  Beethoven .  [165]   ,  His  The Round of the Prisoners  (1890) was painted after an  engraving  by  Gustave Doré  (1832–1883). Tralbaut suggests that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself;  [166]    Jan Hulsker  discounts this.  [167]   ,  Between February and April 1890 Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse. Depressed and unable to bring himself to write, he was still able to paint and draw a little during this time,  [168]   and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases \"from memory\\xa0...  reminisces of the North \".  [169]   Among these was  Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset . Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh\\'s illness had a significant effect on his work.  [170]   Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches.  [171]   Belonging to this period is   Sorrowing Old Man (\"At Eternity\\'s Gate\")  , a colour study Hulsker describes as \"another unmistakable remembrance of times long past\".  [90]    [172]   His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, according to the art critic  Robert Hughes , \"longing for concision and grace\".

Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo   [90]   ,   Albert Aurier  praised his work in the   Mercure de France   in January 1890, and described him as \"a genius\".  [173]   In February Van Gogh painted five versions of   L\\'Arlésienne  (Madame Ginoux) , based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888.  [174]    [note 10]   Also in February, Van Gogh was invited by   Les XX  , a society of  avant-garde  painters in Brussels, to participate in  their annual exhibition . At the opening dinner a  Les XX  member,  Henry de Groux , insulted Van Gogh\\'s work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh\\'s honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group. Later, while Van Gogh\\'s exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris,  Claude Monet  said that his work was the best in the show.  [175]   After the birth of his nephew, Van Gogh wrote, \"I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of  white almond blossom  against a blue sky.\"  [176]   ,  In May 1890 Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both  Dr Paul Gachet  in  Auvers-sur-Oise  and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists –  Camille Pissarro  had recommended him. Van Gogh\\'s first impression was that Gachet was \"iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let\\'s say just as much.\"  [177]   ,  The painter  Charles Daubigny  moved to Auvers in 1861, and in turn drew other artists there, including  Camille Corot  and  Honoré Daumier . In July 1890, Van Gogh completed two paintings of   Daubigny\\'s Garden  , one of which is likely his final work.  [178]   ,  During his last weeks, at Saint-Rémy, his thoughts returned to \" memories of the North \",  [169]   and several of the approximately 70 oils, painted during as many days in Auvers-sur-Oise, are reminiscent of northern scenes.  [179]   In June 1890, he painted several portraits of his doctor, including   Portrait of Dr Gachet  , and his only  etching . In each the emphasis is on Gachet\\'s melancholic disposition.  [180]   There are other paintings which are probably unfinished, including   Thatched Cottages by a Hill .   [178]   ,  In July, Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\".  [181]   He had first become captivated by the fields in May, when the wheat was young and green. In July he described to Theo \"vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies\".  [182]   ,  He wrote that they represented his \"sadness and extreme loneliness\", and that the \"canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside\".  [183]     Wheatfield with Crows  , from July 1890, is a painting Hulsker discusses as being associated with \"melancholy and extreme loneliness\".  [184]   Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings from Auvers that follow the completion of  Wheatfield with Crows .  [185]   ,  On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a 7mm  Lefaucheux  à broche  revolver .  [186]    [187]   There were no witnesses and he died 30 hours after the incident.  [160]   The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn.  [188]   The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the  Auberge Ravoux , where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning Theo rushed to his brother\\'s side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent\\'s last words were: \"The sadness will last forever\".  [189]    [190]    [191]    [192]   ,  Van Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh,  Andries Bonger ,  Charles Laval ,  Lucien Pissarro , Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet, among twenty family, friends and locals. Theo had been ill, and his health began to decline further after his brother\\'s death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent\\'s absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at  Den Dolder , and was buried in Utrecht.  [193]   In 1914,  Johanna van Gogh-Bonger  had Theo\\'s body  exhumed  and moved from Utrecht to be re-buried alongside Vincent\\'s at Auvers-sur-Oise.  [194]   ,  There have been numerous debates as to the nature of  Van Gogh\\'s illness  and its effect on his work, and many  retrospective diagnoses  have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning.  [195]   Perry was the first to suggest  bipolar disorder  in 1947,  [196]   and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer.  [197]    [198]   Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with  acute intermittent porphyria , noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious.  [195]    Temporal lobe epilepsy  with bouts of depression has also been suggested.  [198]   Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.  [198]   ,  Van Gogh drew and painted with  watercolours  while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged.  [199]   When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh\\'s work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures\\xa0– highly elaborate studies in black and white,  [note 11]   which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.  [201]   ,  In August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working   en plein air  . Vincent wrote that he could now \"go on painting with new vigour\".  [202]   From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known  Hague School  artists like  Weissenbruch  and  Blommers , and received technical advice from them, as well as from painters like  De Bock  and  Van der Weele , both artists of the Hague School\\'s second generation.  [203]   When he moved to Nuenen after the period in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them.  The Potato Eaters  and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived.  [203]   Following a visit to the  Rijksmuseum , Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick, economical brushwork of the  Dutch Masters , especially  Rembrandt  and  Frans Hals .  [204]    [note 12]   He was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise,  [203]   so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skills.  [205]   ,  Theo criticised  The Potato Eaters  for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style.  [206]   During Van Gogh\\'s stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His   Portrait of Père Tanguy   (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette, and is evidence of an evolving personal style.  [207]    Charles Blanc \\'s treatise on colour interested him greatly, and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that \"colour expresses something in itself\".  [208]    [209]   According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a \"psychological and moral weight\", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of   The Night Cafe  , a work he wanted to \"express the terrible passions of humanity\".  [210]   Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.  [211]   ,  Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature,  [212]   and during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.  [213]   His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols.  [214]   His renditions of the sower, at first copied from  Jean-François Millet , reflect Van Gogh\\'s religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun.  [215]   These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop.  [216]   His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian  iconography  he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life.  [217]   In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint  The Sower .  [208]   ,  Van Gogh stayed within what he called the \"guise of reality\",  [218]   and was critical of overly stylised works.  [219]   He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of  Starry Night  had gone too far and that reality had \"receded too far in the background\".  [219]   Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of  Hokusai \\'s   Great Wave  , the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below, and the painter\\'s vision is \"translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint\".  [220]   ,  Between 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an  oeuvre ,  [221]   a collection that reflected his personal vision, and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc\\'s definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.  [222]   He painted many series of studies;  [218]   most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.  [223]   The work in Arles contributed considerably to his  oeuvre : those he thought the most important from that time were  The Sower ,  Night Cafe ,   Memory of the Garden in Etten   and  Starry Night . With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.  [219]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill.  [224]   Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.  [225]   ,  The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He believed they were \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\"  [223]    [226]   He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism.  [227]   Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.  [228]   ,  In December 1888 he painted  La Berceuse  – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours.  [219]   It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of  Portrait of the Postman  to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in  Madame Roulin with Baby .  [229]   ,   Portrait of Artist\\'s Mother , October 1888,  Norton Simon Museum of Art , Pasadena, California ,    Eugène Boch , (The Poet Against a Starry Sky) , 1888, Musée d\\'Orsay, Paris ,   Portrait of the Postman Joseph Roulin  (1841–1903) early August 1888,  Museum of Fine Arts, Boston  ,   La Berceuse (Augustine Roulin)  1889, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston ,  Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889.  [230]    [note 13]   They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death.  [231]   Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.  [223]    [232]   ,  The self-portraits reflect an unusually high degree of self-scrutiny.  [233]   Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life, for example the mid-1887 Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of  Claude Monet ,  Paul Cezanne  and Signac.  [234]   In  Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat , heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas. It is one of his most renowned self-portraits of that period, \"with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes, and the novel halo derived from the Neo-Impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a \\'purposeful\\' canvas\".  [235]   ,  They contain a wide array of  physiognomical  representations.  [230]   Van Gogh\\'s mental and physical condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.  [230]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s gaze is seldom directed at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin.  [232]   Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter.  [230]   Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.  [236]    [237]   ,   Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat , Winter 1887–88. Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam ,    Self-Portrait with Straw Hat  , Paris, Winter 1887–88.

His Saint-Rémy self-portraits show his side with the unmutilated ear, as he saw himself in the mirror ,   Self-Portrait Without Beard , c. September 1889. This painting may have been Van Gogh\\'s last self-portrait. He gave it to his mother as a birthday gift.  [238]    [239]   ,  Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses,  lilacs ,  irises , and  sunflowers . Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese  ukiyo-e .  [240]   There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles, and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light.  [241]   Both are built from  thickly layered paintwork , which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the \"texture of the seed-heads\".  [242]   ,  In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin,  [134]   who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, \"I\\'m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won\\'t surprise you when it\\'s a question of painting large sunflowers\\xa0... If I carry out this plan there\\'ll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it\\'s a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"  [243]   ,  The sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin\\'s visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the   Yellow House\\'s guest room   in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions.  [134]   After Gauguin\\'s departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the  Berceuse Triptych , and included them in his   Les XX  in Brussels exhibit . Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.

[246]   He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death.  [214]   The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground.  [247]   Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he went on to say, \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\"  [248]   ,  In mid-1889, and at his sister Wil\\'s request, Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of   Wheat Field with Cypresses  .  [249]   The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include  The Starry Night , in which cypresses dominate the foreground.  [246]   ,  Other works from this period include   Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background   (1889, about which in a letter to his brother Van Gogh wrote, \"At last I have a landscape with olives\"  [250]  ),  Cypresses  (1889),  Cypresses with Two Figures  (1889–90), and   Road with Cypress and Star   (1890).  [250]   While in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh spent time outside the asylum, where he painted trees in the olive groves. In these works natural life is rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world, which are, according to Hughes, filled with \"a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation\".

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York ,  The   Flowering Orchards   (also the  Orchards in Blossom ) are among the first groups of work completed after Van Gogh\\'s arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\".  [251]   Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I\\'ve spoiled\".  [252]   ,  During this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner.  [251]   Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including   View of Arles, Flowering Orchards  .  [253]   Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the  Mediterranean climate  his palette significantly brightened.  [254]   ,   The Pink Orchard  also  Orchard with Blossoming Apricot Trees , March 1888.

Neue Pinakothek , Munich ,  Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including  The Old Mill  (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond.  [116]   At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in  The Wheat Field  series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.  [255]   ,  Many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of Van Gogh\\'s death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns.  [256]    [257]   Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\".  [181]   ,  Van Gogh was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. His  Wheatfields at Auvers with White House  shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues, which creates a sense of idyllic harmony.  [258]   ,  About 10 July 1890 Van Gogh wrote to Theo of \"vast fields of wheat under troubled skies\".  [259]     Wheatfield with Crows   shows the artist\\'s state of mind in his final days; Hulsker describes the work as a \"doom-filled painting with threatening skies and ill-omened crows\".  [184]   Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes convey a sense of menace.

[261]   In 1887  André Antoine  hung Van Gogh\\'s alongside works of  Georges Seurat  and  Paul Signac , at the  Théâtre Libre  in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy.  [262]   In 1889 his work was described in the journal   Le Moderniste Illustré   by Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\".  [263]   Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890.  [264]   ,  After Van Gogh\\'s death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at   Les XX  ; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels.  [264]   In 1892  Octave Mirbeau  wrote that Van Gogh\\'s suicide was an \"infinitely sadder loss for art\\xa0... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived.\"  [262]   ,  Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent\\'s most vocal and well-connected champion.  [265]   Theo\\'s widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband or her brother-in law very long and who suddenly had to take care of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh.  [261]    [note 14]   Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh\\'s reputation, and Johanna\\'s brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work.  [261]   Aurier, one of Van Gogh\\'s earliest supporters among the critics, died of  typhoid fever  in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.  [267]   ,  In 1892 Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh\\'s paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894 the  Durand-Rue Gallery  in Paris agreed to take 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh\\'s estate.  [267]   In 1896, the  Fauvist painter   Henri Matisse , then an unknown art student, visited  John Peter Russell  on  Belle Île  off Brittany.  [268]    [269]   Russell had been a close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman\\'s work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by Van Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.  [269]    [270]   ,  In Paris in 1901 a large Van Gogh retrospective was held at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, which excited  André Derain  and  Maurice de Vlaminck , and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism.  [267]   Important group exhibitions took place with the  Sonderbund  artists in Cologne in 1912, the  Armory Show , New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914.  [271]    Henk Bremmer  was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh,  [272]   and introduced  Helene Kröller-Müller  to Van Gogh\\'s art; she became an avid collector of his work.  [273]   The early figures in  German Expressionism  such as  Emil Nolde  acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh\\'s work.  [274]   Bremmer assisted  Jacob Baart de\\xa0la\\xa0Faille , whose   catalogue raisonné    L\\'Oeuvre de Vincent van Gogh  appeared in 1928.  [275]    [note 15]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before  World War I ,  [278]   helped by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914.  [279]   His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind.  [9]   These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young.  [280]   In 1934 the novelist  Irving Stone  published an account of Van Gogh\\'s life titled   Lust for Life  , based on Van Gogh\\'s letters to Theo. This book and the  1956 film of the same name  further enhanced his fame.  [281]   ,  In 1957  Francis Bacon  based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh\\'s  The Painter on the Road to Tarascon , the original of which was destroyed during the  Second World War . Bacon was inspired by an image he described as \"haunting\", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh\\'s theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: \"[R]eal painters do not paint things as they are\\xa0... [T]hey paint them as  they themselves  feel them to be.\"  [282]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s works are among the world\\'s  most expensive paintings . Those sold for over  US$ 100\\xa0million (today\\'s equivalent) include  Portrait of Dr Gachet ,  [283]     Portrait of Joseph Roulin   and  Irises . The  Metropolitan Museum of Art \\'s version of   Wheat Field with Cypresses   was acquired in 1993 for US$57\\xa0million.  [284]   In 2015   L\\'Allée des Alyscamps   sold for US$66.3\\xa0million at Sotheby\\'s, New York, exceeding its reserve of US$40\\xa0million.  [285]   ,  Van Gogh\\'s nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978),  [286]   inherited the estate after his mother\\'s death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection.  [287]   Theo\\'s son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect  Gerrit Rietveld  was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964  Kisho Kurokawa  took charge.  [288]   Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.  [286]   ,  The  Van Gogh Museum  opened in the  Museumplein  in Amsterdam in 1973.  [289]   It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the  Rijksmuseum , regularly receiving more than 1.5 million visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9 million;  [290]   85 percent of the visitors come from other countries.  [291]   ]',\n",
       " '[  Jan Alojzy Matejko  ( Polish pronunciation:\\xa0   [jan aˈlɔjzɨ maˈtɛjko]   \\xa0(      \\xa0  listen   ) ; also known as  Jan Mateyko ; June 24, 1838  [nb 1]   – November 1, 1893) was a Polish  painter  known for paintings of notable historical Polish political and military events.  [2]    [3]   His works include large  oil on canvas  paintings like   Rejtan   (1866),   Union of Lublin   (1869) or   Battle of Grunwald   (1878), numerous portraits, a gallery of  Polish kings , and  murals  in  St. Mary\\'s Basilica, Kraków . He is counted among the most famous  Polish painters .  [2]    [3]    [4]   ,  Matejko spent most of his life in  Kraków . His teachers at the  Kraków Academy of Fine Arts  included  Wojciech Korneli Stattler  and  Władysław Łuszczkiewicz . Later, he became a director at this institution, which eventually was renamed the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts. A number of his students became prominent painters themselves, including  Maurycy Gottlieb ,  Jacek Malczewski ,  Józef Mehoffer  and  Stanisław Wyspiański . ,   ,   ,  Matejko was born on June 24, 1838, in the  Free City of Kraków .  [2]   His father,  Franciszek Ksawery Matejko  ( Czech :   František Xaver Matějka  ) (born 1789 or January 13, 1793, died October 26, 1860), a Czech from the village of  Roudnice , was a graduate of the  Hradec Králové  school who later became a tutor and  music teacher .  [2]   He first worked for the Wodzicki family in Kościelniki, Poland, then moved to  Kraków , where he married the half-German, half-Polish Joanna Karolina Rossberg (Rozberg).  [2]   Jan was the ninth child of eleven children.  [5]   He grew up in a  kamienica  building on  Floriańska Street .  [6]   After the death of his mother in 1845, Jan and his siblings were cared for by his maternal aunt, Anna Zamojska.  [5]   ,  At a young age he witnessed the  Kraków revolution  of 1846 and the 1848  siege of Kraków  by the Austrians, the two events which ended the existence of the  Free City of Kraków .  [2]   His two older brothers served in these battles, under General  Józef Bem ; one died and the other was forced into exile.  [2]   Matejko attended  St. Ann\\'s High School , but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades.  [7]   From his earliest days Matejko showed artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic areas.  [7]   He never mastered a foreign language.  [8]   Despite that and because of his exceptional talent he studied at the  School of Fine Arts in Kraków  from 1852 to 1858.  [2]   His teachers included  Wojciech Korneli Stattler  and  Władysław Łuszczkiewicz .  [9]   He selected  historical painting  as his specialization, and finished his first major work,  Tsars Shuyski before Zygmunt III  ( Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III ), in 1853 (he would return to this topic in a year before his death, in 1892  [10]  ).  [9]    [11]   During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the  Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts  (starting with 1855).  [11]   His seminal project for his graduation in 1858 was   Sigismund I the Old  ennobles the professors of the  Jagiellonian University   ( Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego ).  [12]   ,  After graduation,  [12]   Matejko received a scholarship in 1859 to study with  Hermann Anschütz  at the  Academy of Fine Arts, Munich .  [11]   The following year he received a scholarship to study at the  Academy of Fine Arts Vienna  as well, but after a few days and a major quarrel with  Christian Ruben , Matejko returned to Kraków.  [13]   and opened a studio at his family home in Floriańska Street.  [13]   It would however be years before he would gain commercial success; for a time he was the proverbial \"starving artist\", who celebrated when he sold a canvas (the  Tsars Shuyski... ) for five  gulden .  [2]   ,  In 1860 Matejko published an illustrated album,   Clothing in Poland   ( Ubiory w Polsce ), a project reflecting his intense interest in historical records of all kinds and his desire to promote such interest among Polish people, to intensify their patriotism.  [13]   His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings,  Death of Wapowski during the crowning of Henry Valois  ( Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego , 1861) and  Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka  ( Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki , 1862), which settled his debts.  [14]   In 1862 he finished a painting,   Stańczyk  . Initially received without much applause, in time this would become known as one of Matejko\\'s most famous masterpieces.  [15]   It marks a visible transition in Matejko\\'s art style, from simply illustrating history to creating a philosophical and moral commentary of it.  [13]   ,  During the  January Uprising  of 1863, in which he did not participate because of poor health, Matejko gave financial support, donating most of his savings to the cause, and personally  transported arms  to the insurgents\\' camp.  [13]   His   Skarga\\'s Sermon   ( Kazanie Skargi ), finished in May 1864, was displayed in the gallery of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, which gained him much publicity.  [13]   On 5 November that year, in recognition for his contributions to recreating historical themes, he became a member of the  Kraków Scientific Society  ( Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie ).  [16]   Soon afterward, on 21 November, he married  Teodora Giebultowska , with whom he would have five children: Beata,  Helena , Tadeusz, Jerzy and Regina.  [13]   Helena, his daughter, also an artist, helped victims in  World War I  and was awarded the  Cross of Independence  by  president   Stanisław Wojciechowski .  [17]   ,  At that time Matejko started to gain international recognition. In 1865 Matejko\\'s painting  Skarga\\'s Sermon  was awarded a gold medal at the yearly Paris salon; soon afterwards Count  Maurycy Potocki  \\xa0( pl )  bought it for 10,000 guldens.  [2]   In 1867, his painting   Rejtan   was awarded a gold medal at the  World Exhibition  in Paris and acquired by Emperor  Franz Joseph I of Austria  for 50,000 franks.  [18]    [19]   His next major painting was the   Union of Lublin   ( Unia Lubelska ), created in the years 1867-1869. Once again applauded in Paris, it won Matejko a Cross of the French  Légion d\\'honneur .  [20]   and was purchased by the  Sejm of Galicia .  [21]    Union...  was followed by   Stefan Batory at Pskov   ( Stefan Batory pod Pskowem ), finished in 1871.  [20]   In 1872 he visited  Istanbul  in the  Ottoman Empire , and upon his return to Kraków finished   Astronomer Copernicus, or Conversations with God   ( Astronom Kopernik, czyli rozmowa z Bogiem ), which was acquired by the  Jagiellonian University .  [20]   From the 1870s he was aided in many tasks by a secretary,  Marian Gorzkowski , who would become his \"right hand\", his closest friend, a model for a number of paintings, and an author of memoirs about Matejko.  [21]    [22]   ,  In 1872 during an exhibition in  Prague  he was offered a directorship of the  Academy of Fine Arts, Prague , and soon afterwards, a similar position at Kraków\\'s School of Fine Arts.  [20]   He accepted the Kraków offer, and was for many years the principal ( rector ) of the Academy of Fine Arts.  [20]   In 1874 he finished   Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta   ( The Hanging of the Sigismund bell ).  [23]   In 1878 he finished another masterpiece,   Battle of Grunwald  .  [21]   That year he received an \"honorary grand gold\" medal in Paris, and the city council of Kraków presented him with a ceremonial  scepter , a symbol of his \"royal status in fine arts\".  [21]   In 1879 he finished   Rok 1863 - Polonia   (Year 1863 - Polonia), his take on the  January Uprising  of that time. Begun in 1864, a year after the Uprising he himself had lived through and where he lost a number of friends and family members, this canvas languished unfinished until prince  Władysław Czartoryski  became interested in acquiring it; it is still considered unfinished.  [13]    [24]    [25]   ,  Years 1880-1882 marked his work on another large painting,   Prussian Tribute   ( Hołd Pruski ).  [21]   Matejko gifted this painting to \"the Polish nation\", and it earned him  honorary citizenship  of Kraków; one of the squares in the city was also named  Matejko Square .  [21]   In 1883 he finished   Sobieski at Vienna   ( Sobieski pod Wiedniem ).  [11]    [21]    Sobieski...  was gifted to  Pope Leo XIII  as a \"gift of the Polish nation\" and Matejko, who was one of the members of the group delivering it, received a Knight Commander with Star  Order of Pius IX .  [26]   At that time he also became a vocal spokesman in a number of political issues, publishing letters on issues such as  Polish-Russian relations .  [26]   Another arena he was very engaged in were efforts to protect and reconstruct various historical monuments in the city of Kraków.  [27]   In 1886, he finished a painting about French rather than about Polish history:   Virgin of Orléans  , portraying  Joan of Arc .  [26]    [28]   ,  Next year Matejko received a  Doctor of Philosophy  degree,  honoris causa , from the  Jagiellonian University , and the Austrian   Litteris et Artibus  .  [26]   In 1888 he finished   Batte of Racławice   ( Bitwa pod Racławicami ).  [26]   In 1888-1899, to justify his new academic title, he published a cycle of twelve sketches with an accompanying commentary,   History of civilization in Poland   ( Dzieje Cywilizacji w Polsce ).  [23]    [26]   From 1890 to 1892 he published another cycle of sketches, this time of  Polish kings  (  Poczet królów i książąt polskich   -  Fellowship of the kings and princes of Poland ), which over the years became so popular that its portraits are seen as the canon portrayals of their subjects.  [26]    [29]   1891 saw him finishing   Constitution of the 3 May   ( Konstytucja 3 Maja ).  [26]   He then began composing another large painting,   Oaths of Jan Kazimierz   ( Śluby Jana Kazimierza ), but it remained unfinished due to his death.  [26]   In 1892, a year before his death, he finished a   Self-portrait   ( Autoportret ).  [26]   ,  Matejko suffering from a  peptic ulcer , and died in Kraków on November 1 that year of internal bleeding.  [27]   His funeral on November 5 drew large crowds, and his death was mentioned in at least thirty two European newspapers.  [30]   He was buried in the Kraków\\'s  Rakowicki Cemetery .  [27]   ,  He is counted among the most famous  Polish painters ,  [2]    [3]   described as \"Poland\\'s greatest historical painter\"  [4]   and \"a cult figure to the nation at large... [already] by the time of his death.\".  [23]   His style was praised for being \"colourful, detailed and imaginative\".  [23]   He succeeded in propagating Polish history, and reminding the world about Poland, while his country remained partitioned and without any independent political representation.  [2]   His works, disseminated in thousands of reproductions, have become almost standard illustrations of many key events in  Polish history .  [2]    [3]   His 1860 illustrated album  Ubiory w Polsce  (Clothing in Poland) is seen as a valuable historical reference.  [31]   Critics of his work have pointed to his use of traditional painting style (\"antiquarian realism\", \"theatrical effects\").  [32]   At exhibitions abroad the nuanced historical context of his works would be often lost on foreign audiences.  [11]    [23]   Occasionally his paintings would cause controversy; for example  Rejtan  offended a number of prominent members of Polish nobility, who saw the painting as an indictment of their entire social class.  [20]    [23]   His paintings were subject to censorship in the  Russian Empire , and  Nazi Germany  planned to destroy  Battle of Grunwald  and the  Prussian Homage , which the Nazi authorities considered offensive to the German view of history (those paintings were among many that the Germans planned to purposefully destroy in their  war on Polish culture ; both were however successfully hidden by the members of  Poland resistance ).  [33]   ,  Many of his works are dedicated to famous events in Polish history. Matejko was focusing on major themes in Polish history and using historical sources to paint events in minute historical detail.  [34]   His earliest paintings are simple historical paintings with no hidden messages.  [13]   The later ones, starting with the painting   Stańczyk   (1862), are intended to inspire the viewers with a patriotic message.  [13]    [35]    Stańczyk  focuses on the court jester, portrayed as a symbol of country\\'s conscience, sitting in a chair in the background of a party - a sole figure reflecting on the war, ignored by the joyful crowd.  [23]   ,  In addition to history paintings Matejko made also numerous portraits.  [26]   Among others: portraits of Jagiellonian University rectors  Józef Szujski  and  Stanisław Tarnowski , and numerous portraits of family and friends, including  Wife in the wedding dress  (\"Żona w sukni ślubnej\") (1865, destroyed by his wife during a quarrel and recreated in 1879) and a self-portrait (1892).  [26]   Altogether Matejko authored 320  oil paintings  and several thousands  drawings  and  watercolors . [   citation needed   ]  He also designed the  polychrome  in  St. Mary\\'s Basilica, Kraków  (1889–1891).  [36]   ,  His paintings are on display in numerous Polish museums; including the  National Museum in Warsaw ,  National Museum in Kraków ,  National Museum in Poznań  and  National Museum in Wrocław .  [27]   National Museum in Kraków has a branch dedicated to Matejko -  House of Jan Matejko  ( Dom Jana Matejki ) located in his former studio and family house at Floriańska Street, opened in 1898.  [27]    [37]   Another museum dedicated to Matejko,  Dworek Jana Matejki , opened in  Krzesławice  (where Matejo acquired a  manor   [21]  ) in 1865.  [38]   ,  Over 80 painters have been Matejko\\'s students at some point, many influenced during his tenure as the director of the Kraków School of Fine Arts, and are referred to as members of \"Matejko School\".  [23]    [39]   Prominent among them are  Maurycy Gottlieb ,  [39]    Ephraim Moses Lilien ,  [40]    Jacek Malczewski ,  [39]    Józef Mehoffer ,  [39]    Antoni Piotrowski ,  [39]    Witold Pruszkowski ,  [39]    Leon Wyczółkowski ,  [39]   and  Stanisław Wyspiański .  [39]   ,  The following is a selected list of Matejko\\'s works, in a chronological order. ]',\n",
       " '[  Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy  (   /  ˈ  t  oʊ  l  s  t  ɔɪ  ,   ˈ  t  ɒ  l  -  /   ;  [1]    Russian :  Лев Никола́евич Толсто́й,  Lev Nikolajevič Tolstoj  ,  pronounced\\xa0   [lʲɛf nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪtɕ tɐlˈstoj]   \\xa0(      \\xa0  listen   ) ; 9 September\\xa0[ O.S.  28 August]\\xa01828 – 20 November\\xa0[ O.S.  7 November]\\xa01910), usually referred to in English as  Leo Tolstoy , was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. ,  Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels   War and Peace   (1869) and   Anna Karenina   (1877), often cited as pinnacles of  realist  fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy,   Childhood  ,   Boyhood  , and   Youth   (1852–1856), and   Sevastopol Sketches   (1855), based upon his experiences in the  Crimean War . Tolstoy\\'s fiction includes dozens of short stories and several  novellas  such as   The Death of Ivan Ilyich  ,   Family Happiness  , and   Hadji Murad  . He also wrote  plays  and numerous philosophical essays. ,  In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work   A Confession  . His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the  Sermon on the Mount , caused him to become a fervent  Christian anarchist  and  pacifist . Tolstoy\\'s ideas on  nonviolent resistance , expressed in such works as   The Kingdom of God Is Within You  , were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as  Mohandas Gandhi ,  [2]    Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  [3]   and  James Bevel . Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of  Georgism , the economic philosophy of  Henry George , which he incorporated into his writing, particularly   Resurrection  . ,   ,   ,  Tolstoy was born at  Yasnaya Polyana , a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5\\xa0mi) southwest of  Tula, Russia , and 200 kilometers (120\\xa0mi) south of  Moscow . The  Tolstoys  were a well-known family of old  Russian nobility , tracing their ancestry to a noble named Indris from the  Lithuanian empire  in 1353.  [4]    [5]   He was the fourth of five children of  Count  Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy, a veteran of the  Patriotic War of 1812 , and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (Volkonskaya). Tolstoy\\'s parents died when he was young, so he and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at  Kazan University . His teachers described him as \"both unable and unwilling to learn.\"  [6]   Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much of his time in Moscow and  Saint Petersburg . In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the  Caucasus  and joined the  army . It was about this time that he started writing. ,  His conversion from a dissolute and privileged society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his latter days was brought about by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed the same path were  Alexander Herzen ,  Mikhail Bakunin  and  Peter Kropotkin . During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that would mark the rest of his life. Writing in a letter to his friend  Vasily Botkin : \"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere.\"  [7]   Tolstoy\\'s concept of  non-violence  or  Ahimsa  was bolstered when he read a  German  version of the  Tirukkural . He later instilled the concept in  Mahatma Gandhi  through his  A Letter to a Hindu  when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.  [8]   ,  His European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met  Victor Hugo , whose literary talents Tolstoy praised after reading Hugo\\'s newly finished   Les Misérables  . The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo\\'s novel and Tolstoy\\'s   War and Peace   indicates this influence. Tolstoy\\'s political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Apart from reviewing Proudhon\\'s forthcoming publication,  La Guerre et la Paix  ( War and Peace  in French), whose title Tolstoy would borrow for his masterpiece, the two men discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\" ,  Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for children of Russia\\'s peasants, who had just been  emancipated from serfdom in 1861 . Tolstoy described the school\\'s principles in his 1862 essay \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\".  [9]   Tolstoy\\'s educational experiments were short-lived, partly due to harassment by the  Tsarist  secret police. However, as a direct forerunner to  A. S. Neill \\'s  Summerhill School , the school at Yasnaya Polyana  [10]   can justifiably be claimed the first example of a coherent theory of  democratic education . ,  On September 23, 1862, Tolstoy married  Sophia Andreevna Behrs , who was 16 years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends.  [11]   They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:  [12]   ,  The marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son.  [11]   Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom to compose  War and Peace  and  Anna Karenina  with Sonya acting as his secretary, proofreader and financial manager.  [11]   ,  However, their later life together has been described by  A. N. Wilson  as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy\\'s relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works. ,  The Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the  1905 Russian Revolution  and the subsequent establishment of the  Soviet Union , and Leo Tolstoy\\'s relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Among them are Swedish singer  Viktoria Tolstoy  and Swedish landowner Christopher  Paus ,  Herresta . ,  Tolstoy is one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels   War and Peace   and   Anna Karenina   and novellas such as   Hadji Murad   and   The Death of Ivan Ilyich  . His contemporaries paid him lofty tributes.  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  thought him the greatest of all living novelists.  Gustave Flaubert , on reading a translation of  War and Peace , exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\"  Anton Chekhov , who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic  Matthew Arnold  opined that \"a novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life\".  [13]   ,  Later critics and novelists continue to bear testament to Tolstoy\\'s art.  Virginia Woolf  declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\"  [13]    James Joyce  noted that, \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\".  Thomas Mann  wrote of Tolstoy\\'s seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature\". Such sentiments were shared by the likes of  Proust ,  Faulkner  and  Nabokov . The latter heaped superlatives upon   The Death of Ivan Ilyich   and  Anna Karenina ; he questioned, however, the reputation of  War and Peace , and sharply criticized   Resurrection   and   The Kreutzer Sonata  . ,  Tolstoy\\'s earliest works, the autobiographical novels   Childhood  ,   Boyhood  , and   Youth   (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner\\'s son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy\\'s own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up. ,  Tolstoy served as a  second lieutenant  in an artillery regiment during the  Crimean War , recounted in his   Sevastopol Sketches  . His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent  pacifism  and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.  [14]   ,  His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.  [15]     The Cossacks   (1863) describes the  Cossack  life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl.  Anna Karenina  (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in  War and Peace , Levin in  Anna Karenina  and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in  Resurrection . ,   War and Peace  is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of  Napoleon , from the court of  Alexander I of Russia  to the battlefields of  Austerlitz  and  Borodino . Tolstoy\\'s original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the  Decembrist revolt , to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that  Andrei Bolkonsky \\'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy\\'s theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider  War and Peace  to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the  realist  school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.  [16]    War and Peace  (which is to Tolstoy really an  epic  in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that  Anna Karenina  was his first true novel.  [17]   ,  After  Anna Karenina , Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as  The Death of Ivan Ilyich  (1886) and   What Is to Be Done?   develop a radical  anarcho-pacifist  Christian philosophy which led to his  excommunication  from the  Russian Orthodox Church  in 1901.  [18]   For all the praise showered on  Anna Karenina  and  War and Peace , Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.  [19]   ,  In his novel   Resurrection  ,  Tolstoy  attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of  Georgism , of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life. ,  After reading  Schopenhauer \\'s   The World as Will and Representation  , Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I\\'ve never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\"  [20]   ,  In Chapter VI of   A Confession  , Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer\\'s work. It explained how the nothingness that results from complete  denial of self  is only a relative nothingness, and is not to be feared. The novelist was struck by the description of Christian,  Buddhist , and  Hindu  ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer\\'s ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: ,  But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for  eternal salvation  is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ( Matthew 19:24 ): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose  voluntary poverty  when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus  Buddha   Sakyamuni  was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant\\'s staff; and  Francis of Assisi , the founder of the  mendicant orders  who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \" La povertà  (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.  [21]   ,  In 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called \" What I Believe \", in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in  Jesus Christ \\'s  teachings  and was particularly influenced by the  Sermon on the Mount , and the injunction to  turn the other cheek , which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of  pacifism  and  nonviolence . In his work  The Kingdom of God Is Within You , he explains that he considered mistaken the Church\\'s doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ\\'s teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American  Quakers  who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as  George Fox ,  William Penn  and  Jonathan Dymond . Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the consequences of being a pacifist, and the apparently inevitable waging of war by government, are the reason why he is considered a philosophical anarchist. ,  Later, various versions of \"Tolstoy\\'s Bible\" would be published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.  [22]   ,  Tolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner self-perfection through following the  Great Commandment  of loving one\\'s neighbor and God rather than looking outward to the Church or state for guidance. His belief in  nonresistance  when faced by conflict is another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ\\'s teachings. By directly influencing  Mahatma Gandhi  with this idea through his work   The Kingdom of God Is Within You   (full text of English translation  available on Wikisource ), Tolstoy\\'s profound influence on the nonviolent resistance movement reverberates to this day. He believed that the aristocracy were a burden on the poor, and that the only solution to how we live together is through  anarchism . [   citation needed   ]  ,  He also opposed  private property  in land ownership  [23]   and the institution of marriage and valued the ideals of chastity and sexual abstinence (discussed in   Father Sergius   and his preface to  The Kreutzer Sonata ), ideals also held by the young Gandhi. Tolstoy\\'s later work derives a passion and verve from the depth of his austere moral views.  [24]   The sequence of the temptation of Sergius in  Father Sergius , for example, is among his later triumphs. Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before himself and Chekhov and that Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Other later passages of rare power include the personal crises that were faced by the protagonists of  The Death of Ivan Ilyich , and of   Master and Man  , where the main character in the former or the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists\\' lives. ,  Tolstoy had a profound influence on the development of  Christian anarchist  thought.  [25]   The  Tolstoyans  were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy\\'s companion,  Vladimir Chertkov  (1854–1936), to spread Tolstoy\\'s religious teachings. Philosopher  Peter Kropotkin  wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the   1911 Encyclopædia Britannica  : ,  Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries,  Chojecki ,  Denk  and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the  state  and  property rights , deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in  The Kingdom of God Is Within You ) a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present  property laws . He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.  [26]   ,  During the  Boxer Rebellion  in China, Tolstoy praised the Boxers. He was harshly critical of the atrocities committed by the Russians, Germans, and other western troops. He accused them of engaging in slaughter when he heard about the lootings, rapes, and murders, in what he saw as Christian brutality. Tolstoy also named the two monarchs most responsible for the atrocities;  Nicholas II of Russia  and  Wilhelm II of Germany .  [27]    [28]   Tolstoy, a famous  sinophile , also read the works of Chinese thinker and philosopher,  Confucius .  [29]    [30]    [31]   Tolstoy corresponded with the Chinese intellectual  Gu Hongming  and recommended that China remain an agrarian nation and warned against reform like what Japan implemented. ,  The Russian and American intervention in the Boxer Rebellion was denounced by Tolstoy as were the conflicts in the Philippines by America. The words  terrible for its injustice and cruelty  were used to describe the Czarist intervention by Tolstoy.  [32]   Confucius\\'s works were studied by Tolstoy. The attack on China in the Boxer Rebellion was railed against be Tolstoy.  [33]   The war against China was criticized by Leonid Andreev and Gorkey.  to the Chinese people , an epistle was written by Tolstoy as part of the criticism of the war by intellectuals in Russia.  [34]   The activities of Russia in China by Nicholas II were described in an open letter where they were slammed and denounced by Leo Tolstoy in 1902.  [35]   Tolstoy corresponded with  Gu Hongming  and both they opposed the  Hundred Day\\'s Reform  by  Kang Youwei  and agreed that the reform movement was perilous.  [36]   Tolstoys\\' ideology on non violence shaped the anarchist thought of the Society for the Study of Socialism in China.  [37]   Lao Zi and Confucius\\'s teachings were studied by Tolstoy.  Chinese Wisdom\\'  was a text written by Tolstoy. The Boxer Rebellion stirred Tolstoy\\'s interest in Chinese philosophy.  [38]   The Boxer and Boxer wars were denounced by Tolstoy.  [39]   ,  In hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by  Kropotkin  and  Proudhon  to his readers, whilst rejecting anarchism\\'s espousal of  violent revolutionary means . In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy\", he wrote; \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about  anarchist violence , Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of  anarchist thinkers in Russia , and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin\\'s \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.  [40]   ,  Tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of  Henry George , incorporating it approvingly into later works such as   Resurrection   (1899), the book that played a major factor in his excommunication.  [41]   ,  In 1908, Tolstoy wrote   A Letter to a Hindu    [42]   outlining his belief in non-violence as a means for India to gain independence from British colonial rule. In 1909, a copy of the letter was read by Gandhi, who was working as a lawyer in South Africa at the time and just becoming an activist. Tolstoy\\'s letter was significant for Gandhi, who wrote Tolstoy seeking proof that he was the real author, leading to further correspondence between them.  [43]   ,  Reading Tolstoy\\'s  The Kingdom of God Is Within You  also convinced Gandhi to avoid violence and espouse  nonviolent resistance , a debt Gandhi acknowledged in his autobiography, calling Tolstoy \"the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced\". The correspondence between Tolstoy and Gandhi would only last a year, from October 1909 until Tolstoy\\'s death in November 1910, but led Gandhi to give the name Tolstoy Colony to his second  ashram  in South Africa.  [44]   Besides nonviolent resistance, the two men shared a common belief in the merits of  vegetarianism , the subject of several of Tolstoy\\'s essays.  [45]   ,  Tolstoy also became a major supporter of the  Esperanto  movement. Tolstoy was impressed by the pacifist beliefs of the  Doukhobors  and brought their persecution to the attention of the international community, after they burned their weapons in peaceful protest in 1895. He aided the Doukhobors in migrating to Canada.  [46]   In 1904, during the  Russo-Japanese War , Tolstoy condemned the war and wrote to the Japanese Buddhist priest  Soyen Shaku  in a failed attempt to make a joint pacifist statement. ,  Towards the end of his life, Tolstoy become more and more occupied with the economic theory and social philosophy of  Georgism .  [47]    [48]    [49]    [50]   He spoke of great admiration of  Henry George , stating once that \"People do not argue with the teaching of George; they simply do not know it. And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching, for he who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree.\"  [51]   He also wrote a preface to George\\'s   Social Problems  .  [52]   Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income of the passive Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy so heavily criticized) whilst simultaneously both rejecting a centrally planned  socialist  economy. Some assume that this development in Tolstoy\\'s thinking was a move away from his  anarchist  views, since Georgism requires a central administration to collect  land rent  and spend it on infrastructure. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have also been proposed since.  [53]   Tolstoy\\'s 1899 novel  Resurrection  explores his thoughts on Georgism in more detail and hints that Tolstoy indeed had such a view. It suggests the possibility of small communities with some form of local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods; whilst still heavily criticising institutions of the  state  such as the  justice system . ,  Tolstoy died in 1910, at the age of 82. Just prior to his death, his health had been a concern of his family, who were actively engaged in his care on a daily basis. During his last few days, he had spoken and written about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he had finally gathered the nerve to separate from his wife, and left home in the middle of winter, in the dead of night.  [54]   His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape unannounced from Sophia\\'s jealous tirades. She was outspokenly opposed to many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of the attention which it seemed to her Tolstoy lavished upon his  Tolstoyan  \"disciples\". ,  Tolstoy died of  pneumonia   [55]   at  Astapovo  train station, after a day\\'s rail journey south.  [56]   The station master took Tolstoy to his apartment, and his personal doctors were called to the scene. He was given injections of  morphine  and  camphor . ,  The police tried to limit access to his funeral procession, but thousands of peasants lined the streets. Still, some were heard to say that, other than knowing that \"some nobleman had died\", they knew little else about Tolstoy.  [57]   ,  According to some sources, Tolstoy spent the last hours of his life preaching love, nonviolence, and  Georgism  to his fellow passengers on the train.  [58]   ,  A 2009 film about Tolstoy\\'s final year,   The Last Station  , based on the novel by  Jay Parini , was made by director  Michael Hoffman  with  Christopher Plummer  as Tolstoy and  Helen Mirren  as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for  Oscars  for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including   Departure of a Grand Old Man  , made in 1912 just two years after his death,  How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were  (1913), and  Leo Tolstoy , directed by and starring  Sergei Gerasimov  in 1984. ,  There is also a famous lost film of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer  Burton Holmes  visited Yasnaya Polyana with  Albert J. Beveridge , the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge\\'s advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that documentary evidence of a meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge\\'s chances of running for the U.S. presidency.

       " '[  Franz Kafka   [a]   (3 July 1883\\xa0– 3 June 1924) was a  German-language  novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of  20th-century literature . His work, which fuses elements of  realism  and the  fantastic ,  [3]   typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of  alienation ,  existential anxiety ,  guilt , and  absurdity .  [4]   His best known works include \"  Die Verwandlung  \" (\"The Metamorphosis\"),    Der Process    ( The Trial ), and    Das Schloss    ( The Castle ). The term  Kafkaesque  has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.  [5]   ,  Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking  Jewish  family in  Prague , the capital of the  Kingdom of Bohemia , then part of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire , today part of the  Czech Republic . He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education he was employed with an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from  tuberculosis . ,  Few of Kafka\\'s works were published during his lifetime: the story collections    Betrachtung    ( Contemplation ) and    Ein Landarzt    ( A Country Doctor ), and individual stories (such as \" Die Verwandlung \") were published in literary magazines but received little public attention. Kafka\\'s unfinished works, including his novels   Der Process  ,   Das Schloss   and    Amerika    (also known as   Der Verschollene  ,  The Man Who Disappeared ), were ordered by Kafka to be destroyed by his friend  Max Brod , who nonetheless ignored his friend\\'s direction and published them after Kafka\\'s death. His work went on to influence a vast range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers during the 20th century. ,   ,   ,  Kafka was born near the  Old Town Square  in Prague, then part of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire . His family were middle-class  Ashkenazi Jews . His father, Hermann Kafka (1854–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka,  [6]    [7]   a   shochet   or  ritual slaughterer  in  Osek , a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near  Strakonice  in southern Bohemia.  [8]   Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fancy goods and clothing retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a  jackdaw  (  kavka   in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as  kafka ) as his business logo.  [9]   Kafka\\'s mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in  Poděbrady ,  [10]   and was better educated than her husband.  [6]   ,  Kafka\\'s parents probably spoke a German influenced by  Yiddish  that was sometimes pejoratively called  Mauscheldeutsch , but, as the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak  High German .  [11]   Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest.  [12]   Franz\\'s two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (\"Ellie\") (1889–1944), Valerie (\"Valli\") (1890–1942) and  Ottilie  (\"Ottla\") (1892–1943). They all died during the  Holocaust  of World War II. Valli was deported to the  Łódź Ghetto  in Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favorite sister.  [13]   ,  Hermann is described by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a \"huge, selfish, overbearing businessman\"  [14]   and by Franz Kafka as \"a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature\".  [15]   On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12\\xa0hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka\\'s childhood was somewhat lonely,  [16]   and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka\\'s troubled relationship with his father is evident in his    Brief an den Vater    ( Letter to His Father ) of more than 100\\xa0pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father\\'s authoritarian and demanding character;  [17]   his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy.  [18]   The dominating figure of Kafka\\'s father had a significant influence on Kafka\\'s writing.  [19]   ,  The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz\\'s room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli\\'s former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.  [20]   ,  From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the   Deutsche Knabenschule   German boys\\' elementary school at the   Masný trh/Fleischmarkt   (meat market), now known as Masná Street. His Jewish education ended with his  Bar Mitzvah  celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays a year.  [15]    [21]    [22]   ,  After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state  gymnasium ,   Altstädter Deutsches Gymnasium  , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the  Kinský Palace . German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech.  [23]    [24]   He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades.  [25]   Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent.  [1]    [24]   He completed his  Matura  exams in 1901.  [26]   ,  Admitted to the    Deutsche Karl-Ferdinands-Universität    of Prague in 1901, Kafka began studying chemistry, but switched to law after two weeks.  [27]   Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history.  [28]   He also joined a student club,   Lese- und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten   (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organized literary events, readings and other activities.  [29]   Among Kafka\\'s friends were the journalist  Felix Weltsch , who studied philosophy, the actor  Yitzchak Lowy  who came from an orthodox  Hasidic  Warsaw family, and the writers  Oskar Baum  and  Franz Werfel .  [30]   ,  At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met  Max Brod , a fellow law student who became a close friend for life.  [29]   Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound.  [31]   Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life;  [32]   together he and Brod read Plato\\'s   Protagoras   in the original  Greek , on Brod\\'s initiative, and  Flaubert \\'s    L\\'éducation sentimentale    and    La Tentation de St. Antoine    ( The Temptation of Saint Anthony ) in French, at his own suggestion.  [33]   Kafka considered  Fyodor Dostoyevsky , Flaubert,  Nikolai Gogol ,  Franz Grillparzer ,  [34]   and  Heinrich von Kleist  to be his \"true  blood brothers \".  [35]   Besides these, he took an interest in  Czech literature   [23]    [24]   and was also very fond of the works of  Goethe .  [36]    [37]   Kafka was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906  [b]   and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.  [5]   ,  On 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the    Assicurazioni Generali   , an Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00  [40]    [41]  —making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the  Worker\\'s Accident Insurance Institute  for the  Kingdom of Bohemia . The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for  personal injury  to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor  work safety  policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with  machine   lathes ,  drills ,  planing machines  and  rotary saws  which were rarely fitted with safety guards. ,  The management professor  Peter Drucker  credits Kafka with developing the first civilian  hard hat  while employed at the Worker\\'s Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer.  [42]    [43]   His father often referred to his son\\'s job as an insurance officer as a   Brotberuf  , literally \"bread job\", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums.  [44]   He would compile and compose the  annual report  on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors.  [45]   Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed.  [46]   Kafka\\'s father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store.  [47]   In his later years, Kafka\\'s illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term   Der enge Prager Kreis   (\"The Close Prague Circle\") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.  [48]    [49]   ,  In late 1911, Elli\\'s husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first  asbestos  factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann &amp; Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time.  [50]   During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of  Yiddish theatre . After seeing a Yiddish theater troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka \"immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature\".  [51]   This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism.  [52]   It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian.  [53]   Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World War \\xa0 I, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with  tuberculosis ,  [54]   with which he was diagnosed in 1917.  [55]   In 1918 the Worker\\'s Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in  sanatoriums .  [5]   ,  Kafka was never married. According to Brod, Kafka was \"tortured\" by sexual desire  [56]   and Kafka\\'s biographer  Reiner Stach  states that his life was full of \"incessant womanising\" and that he was filled with a fear of \"sexual failure\".  [57]   He visited brothels for most of his adult life  [58]    [59]    [60]   and was interested in pornography.  [56]   In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met  Felice Bauer , a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a  dictaphone  company. A week after the meeting at Brod\\'s home, Kafka wrote in his diary: ,  Miss FB. When I arrived at Brod\\'s on 13 August, she was sitting at the table. I was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at once. Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was. (I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so closely\\xa0...) Almost broken nose. Blonde, somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat I looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an unshakeable opinion.  [61]    [62]   ,  Shortly after this, Kafka wrote the story \"  Das Urteil  \" (\"The Judgment\") in only one night and worked in a productive period on    Der Verschollene    ( The Man Who Disappeared ) and \" Die Verwandlung \" (\"The Metamorphosis\"). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice.  [63]   Kafka\\'s extant letters to her were published as    Briefe an Felice    ( Letters to Felice ); her letters do not survive.  [61]    [64]    [65]   According to biographers Stach and  James Hawes , around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid.  [63]    [66]   Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time Kafka began a draft of the  Letter to His Father , who objected to Julie because of her  Zionist  beliefs. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman.  [67]   While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was shy—especially about his body.  [5]   ,  Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe \"Grete\" Bloch,  [68]   a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka\\'s son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921.  [69]    [70]   However, Kafka\\'s biographer Peter-André Alt claims that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate.  [71]    [72]   Stach states that Bloch had a son, but there is not solid proof and moreover contradictory evidence that Kafka was the father.  [73]   ,  Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the  Bohemian  village of Zürau (Siřem in the  Czech language ), where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Karl Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best time in his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and   Oktavhefte   ( octavo ). From the notes in these books, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on  Zettel , single pieces of paper in no given order. They were later published as    Die Zürauer Aphorismen  oder Betrachtungen über Sünde, Hoffnung, Leid und den wahren Weg   (The Zürau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).  [74]   ,  In 1920 Kafka began an intense relationship with  Milena Jesenská , a Czech journalist and writer. His letters to her were later published as    Letters to Milena   .  [75]   During a vacation in July 1923 to  Graal-Müritz  on the  Baltic Sea , Kafka met  Dora Diamant , a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and caused him to become interested in the  Talmud .  [76]   He worked on four stories, which he prepared to be published as    Ein Hungerkünstler    ( A Hunger Artist ).  [75]   ,  Kafka feared that people would find him mentally and physically repulsive. However, those who met him found him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence, and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance.  [77]    [78]    [79]   Brod compared Kafka to  Heinrich von Kleist , noting that both writers had the ability to describe a situation realistically with precise details.  [80]   Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice.  [81]   According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music.  [82]   Brod felt that two of Kafka\\'s most distinguishing traits were \"absolute truthfulness\" (  absolute Wahrhaftigkeit  ) and \"precise conscientiousness\" (  präzise Gewissenhaftigkeit  ).  [83]    [84]   He explored details, the inconspicuous, in depth and with such love and precision that things surfaced that were unforeseen, seemingly strange, but absolutely true (  nichts als wahr  ).  [85]   ,  Although Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later showed interest in games and physical activity,  [32]   as a good rider, swimmer, and rower.  [83]   On weekends he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself.  [86]   His other interests included  alternative medicine , modern education systems such as  Montessori ,  [83]   and technical novelties such as airplanes and film.  [87]   Writing was important to Kafka; he considered it a \"form of prayer\".  [88]   He was highly sensitive to noise and preferred quiet when writing.  [89]   ,  Pérez-Álvarez has claimed that Kafka may have possessed a  schizoid personality disorder .  [90]   His style, it is claimed, not only in \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"The Metamorphosis\"), but in various other writings, appears to show low to medium-level schizoid traits, which explain much of his work.  [91]   His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:  [92]   ,  The tremendous world I have in my head. But how to free myself and free them without ripping apart. And a thousand times rather tear in me they hold back or buried. For this I\\'m here, that\\'s quite clear to me.  [93]   ,  and in Zürau Aphorism number 50: ,  Man cannot live without a permanent trust in something indestructible within himself, though both that indestructible something and his own trust in it may remain permanently concealed from him.  [94]   ,  Though Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends.  [95]   He may have suffered from an eating disorder. Doctor Manfred M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic,  University of Munich , presented \"evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical  anorexia nervosa \",  [96]   and that Kafka was not just lonely and depressed but also \"occasionally suicidal\".  [78]   In his 1995 book  Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient ,  Sander Gilman  investigated \"why a Jew might have been considered \\' hypochondriac \\' or \\'homosexual\\' and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing\".  [97]   Kafka considered committing suicide at least once, in late 1912.  [98]   ,  Prior to World War\\xa0I,  [99]   Kafka attended several meetings of the Klub Mladých, a Czech anarchist,  anti-militarist , and  anti-clerical  organization.  [100]    Hugo Bergmann , who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900–1901) because \"[Kafka\\'s] socialism and my  Zionism  were much too strident\".  [101]    [102]   \"Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist\".  [102]   Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for socialism.  [102]   In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to the influential anarchist philosopher  Peter Kropotkin : \"Don\\'t forget Kropotkin!\"  [103]   ,  During the communist era, the legacy of Kafka\\'s work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling  Austria-Hungarian Empire , to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism.  [104]   A further key point was  Marx\\'s theory of alienation . While the orthodox position was that Kafka\\'s depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in  Liblice , Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka\\'s portrayal of bureaucracy.  [105]   Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.  [106]   ,  Kafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew.  [107]   He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to  Yiddish writers .  [108]   Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: \"What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe\".  [109]   In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an atheist.  [110]   ,  Hawes suggests that Kafka, though very aware of his own  Jewishness , did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes.  [111]    [112]    [113]   In the opinion of literary critic  Harold Bloom , although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer.  [114]   Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: \"The presence of Jewishness in Kafka\\'s   oeuvre   is no longer subject to doubt\".  [115]    Pavel Eisner , one of Kafka\\'s first translators, interprets   Der Process   ( The Trial ) as the embodiment of the \"triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague \\xa0 ... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the \\'guiltless guilt\\' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew\".  [116]   ,  In his essay  Sadness in Palestine?! ,  Dan Miron  explores Kafka\\'s connection to Zionism: \"It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles\".  [108]   Kafka considered moving to  Palestine  with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied  Hebrew  while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod\\'s from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him  [108]   and attending Rabbi Julius Grünthal\\'s  [117]   and Rabbi  Julius Guttmann \\'s classes in the Berlin    Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums    (College for the Study of Judaism).  [118]   ,  Livia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the \"symbolic figure of his era\".  [116]   His contemporaries included numerous Jewish, Czech, and German writers who were sensitive to Jewish, Czech, and German culture. According to Rothkirchen, \"This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka\".  [116]   ,  Towards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergman in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine. Bergman refused to host Kafka because he had young children and was afraid that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.  [119]   ,  Kafka\\'s  laryngeal   tuberculosis  worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague,  [63]   where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann\\'s sanatorium in  Kierling  just outside  Vienna  for treatment on 10 April,  [75]   and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka\\'s throat made eating too painful for him, and since  parenteral nutrition  had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him.  [120]    [121]   Kafka was editing \"A Hunger Artist\" on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment.  [122]   His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the  New Jewish Cemetery  in  Prague-Žižkov .  [59]   Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He became famous soon after his death.  [88]   The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect  Leopold Ehrmann .  [123]   ,  All of Kafka\\'s published works, except some letters he wrote in Czech to Milena Jesenská, were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention. ,  Kafka finished none of his full-length novels and burned around 90 percent of his work,  [124]    [125]   much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts.  [126]   In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described in a letter to Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than his own family.  [127]   ,  Kafka\\'s earliest published works were eight stories which appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal   Hyperion   under the title    Betrachtung    ( Contemplation ). He wrote the story \"  Beschreibung eines Kampfes  \" (\"Description of a Struggle\")  [c]   in 1904; he showed it to Brod in 1905 who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to  Hyperion . Kafka published a fragment in 1908  [128]   and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.  [129]   ,  In a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story \"Das Urteil\" (\"The Judgment\", literally: \"The Verdict\") and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fiancée, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer.  [130]   The story is often considered Kafka\\'s breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son\\'s engagement.  [131]    [132]   Kafka later described writing it as \"a complete opening of body and soul\",  [133]   a story that \"evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime\".  [134]   The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated \"to Miss Felice Bauer\", and in subsequent editions \"for F.\"  [75]   ,  In 1912, Kafka wrote \"Die Verwandlung\" (\" The Metamorphosis \", or \"The Transformation\"),  [135]   published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a travelling salesman waking to find himself transformed into a   ungeheures Ungeziefer  , a monstrous  vermin ,   Ungeziefer   being a general term for unwanted and unclean animals. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century.  [136]    [137]    [138]   The story \" In der Strafkolonie \" (\"In the Penal Colony\"), dealing with an elaborate  torture  and execution device, was written in October 1914,  [75]   revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story \" Ein Hungerkünstler \" (\"A Hunger Artist\"), published in the periodical    Die neue Rundschau    in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of  starving himself for extended periods .  [139]   His last story, \" Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse \" (\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\"), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.  [140]   ,  He began his first novel in 1912;  [141]   its first chapter is the story \" Der Heizer \" (\"The Stoker\"). Kafka called the work, which remained unfinished,   Der Verschollene   ( The Man Who Disappeared  or  The Missing Man ), but when Brod published it after Kafka\\'s death he named it  Amerika .  [142]   The inspiration for the novel was the time spent in the audience of Yiddish theatre the previous year, bringing him to a new awareness of his heritage, which led to the thought that an innate appreciation for one\\'s heritage lives deep within each person.  [143]   More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka\\'s works, the novel shares the  motif  of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations.  [144]   It uses many details of experiences of his relatives who had emigrated to America  [145]   and is the only work for which Kafka considered an optimistic ending.  [146]   ,  During 1914, Kafka began the novel    Der Process    ( The Trial ),  [129]   the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Kafka did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to  Nobel Prize winner  and Kafka scholar  Elias Canetti , Felice is central to the plot of  Der Process  and Kafka said it was \"her story\".  [147]    [148]   Canetti titled his book on Kafka\\'s letters to Felice  Kafka\\'s Other Trial , in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel.  [148]   Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for   The New York Times   that Kafka\\'s letters have the \"earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation—combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardor and delight.\"  [148]   ,  According to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel    Das Schloss    (The Castle), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922.  [129]   The protagonist is the   Landvermesser   (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka\\'s intent was that the castle\\'s authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his \"legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there\".  [149]   Dark and at times  surreal , the novel is focused on  alienation ,  bureaucracy , the seemingly endless frustrations of man\\'s attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unobtainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: \"Like dreams, his texts combine precise \"realistic\" detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness.\"  [150]   ,  Kafka\\'s stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly  Hyperion .  [151]    Franz Blei  published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of \"Beschreibung eines Kampfes\" (\"Description of a Struggle\").  [151]   A fragment of the story \" Die Aeroplane in Brescia \" (\"The Aeroplanes at Brescia\"), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily   Bohemia   on 28 September 1909.  [151]    [152]   On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book    Betrachtung    were published in the Easter edition of  Bohemia .  [151]    [153]   In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher  Kurt Wolff  included \" Das Urteil. Eine Geschichte von Franz Kafka. \" (\"The Judgment. A Story by Franz Kafka.\") in their literary yearbook for the art poetry  Arkadia . The story \"  Vor dem Gesetz  \" (\"Before the Law\") was published in the 1915 New Year\\'s edition of the independent Jewish weekly   Selbstwehr  ; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection    Ein Landarzt    ( A Country Doctor ) and became part of the novel   Der Process  . Other stories were published in various publications, including  Martin Buber \\'s   Der Jude  , the paper    Prager Tagblatt   , and the periodicals    Die neue Rundschau   ,   Genius  , and   Prager Presse  .  [151]   ,  Kafka\\'s first published book,   Betrachtung   ( Contemplation , or  Meditation ), was a collection of 18 \\xa0 stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to  Weimar , Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff;  [154]   Wolff published   Betrachtung   in the   Rowohlt Verlag   at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913).  [155]   Kafka dedicated it to Brod, \" Für M.B. \", and added in the personal copy given to his friend \" So wie es hier schon gedruckt ist, für meinen liebsten Max\\u200d—\\u200cFranz K. \" (\"As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max\").  [156]   ,  Kafka\\'s story \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"The Metamorphosis\") was first printed in the October 1915 issue of    Die Weißen Blätter   , a monthly edition of  expressionist  literature, edited by  René Schickele .  [155]   Another story collection,   Ein Landarzt   ( A Country Doctor ), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919,  [155]   dedicated to Kafka\\'s father.  [157]   Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print,   Ein Hungerkünstler    (A Hunger Artist) , which appeared in 1924 after his death, in    Verlag Die Schmiede   . On 20 April 1924, the    Berliner Börsen-Courier    published Kafka\\'s essay on  Adalbert Stifter .  [158]   ,  Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and  literary executor  Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka\\'s death; Kafka wrote: \"Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me \\xa0 ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others\\'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread\".  [159]    [160]   Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939.  [161]   Kafka\\'s last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20 \\xa0 notebooks and 35 \\xa0 letters. These were confiscated by the  Gestapo  in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.  [162]   ,  As Brod published the bulk of the writings in his possession,  [163]   Kafka\\'s work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to arrange Kafka\\'s notebooks in chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end.  [164]    [165]   Brod finished many of Kafka\\'s incomplete works for publication. For example, Kafka left   Der Process   with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and   Das Schloss   with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content;  [165]   Brod rearranged chapters, copy edited the text, and changed the punctuation.   Der Process   appeared in 1925 in   Verlag Die Schmiede  . Kurt Wolff published two other novels,   Das Schloss   in 1926 and  Amerika  in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as    Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer     (The Great Wall of China) , including the  story of the same name . The book appeared in the    Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlag   . Brod\\'s sets are usually called the \"Definitive Editions\".  [166]   ,  In 1961,  Malcolm Pasley  acquired most of Kafka\\'s original handwritten work for the  Oxford   Bodleian Library .  [167]    [168]   The text for   Der Process   was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in  Marbach am Neckar , Germany.  [168]    [169]   Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including  Gerhard Neumann , Jost Schillemeit and Jürgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels;   S. Fischer Verlag   republished them.  [170]   Pasley was the editor for   Das Schloss  , published in 1982, and   Der Process (The Trial)  , published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of   Der Verschollene    ( Amerika )  published in 1983. These are called the \"Critical Editions\" or the \"Fischer Editions\".  [171]   ,  When Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka\\'s unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary  Esther Hoffe .  [172]   She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the  National Library of Israel , which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to  British Palestine  in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of   Der Process   for US$2\\xa0million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive  Museum of Modern Literature  in Marbach am Neckar.  [124]    [173]   Only Eva was still alive as of 2012.  [174]   A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued.  [175]   The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library argues they are \"cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people\".  [175]   The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012 that the papers were the property of the National Library.  [176]   ,  The poet  W. H. Auden  called Kafka \"the  Dante  of the twentieth century\";  [177]   the novelist  Vladimir Nabokov  placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century.  [178]    Gabriel García Márquez  noted the reading of Kafka\\'s \"The Metamorphosis\" showed him \"that it was possible to write in a different way\".  [109]    [179]   A prominent theme of Kafka\\'s work, first established in the short story \"Das Urteil\",  [180]   is father–son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement.  [17]    [180]   Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.  [181]   ,  Kafka\\'s style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of \"Die Verwandlung\" and \"Der Heizer\" by Oscar Walzel in  Berliner Beiträge .  [182]   The nature of Kafka\\'s prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools.  [106]    Marxists , for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka\\'s works.  [100]    [106]   Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism.  [106]   The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of  existentialism .  [183]   Some of Kafka\\'s books are influenced by the  expressionist  movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental  modernist  genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burroughs claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships.  [184]   Others, such as  Thomas Mann , see Kafka\\'s work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.  [185]    [186]   ,  According to  Gilles Deleuze  and  Félix Guattari , the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka\\'s work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka\\'s work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading his work while focusing on the futility of his characters\\' struggles reveals Kafka\\'s play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds.  [187]    [188]   Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer  Milan Kundera  suggests that Kafka\\'s  surrealist humour  may have been an inversion of Dostoyevsky\\'s presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka\\'s work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka\\'s inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.  [189]   ,  Attempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka\\'s legal background and the role of law in his fiction.  [190]    [191]   Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work,  [192]   in which the legal system is often oppressive.  [193]   The law in Kafka\\'s works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control.  [192]   Critics who support this  absurdist  interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary: ,  Enclosed in my own four walls, I found myself as an immigrant imprisoned in a foreign country;... I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites, and very language defied comprehension;... though I did not want it, they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals;... I could not resist.  [194]   ,  However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka\\'s descriptions of the legal proceedings in   Der Process  —metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear—are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were  inquisitorial  rather than  adversarial .  [195]   Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was \"keenly aware of the legal debates of his day\".  [191]    [196]   In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka\\'s office writings as its point of departure,  [197]   Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law \"has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination\".  [198]   ,  The earliest English translations of Kafka\\'s works were by  Edwin and Willa Muir , who in 1930 translated the first German edition of   Das Schloss  . This was published as  The Castle  by  Secker &amp; Warburg  in England and  Alfred A. Knopf  in the United States.  [199]   A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka\\'s popularity in the United States during the late 1940s.  [200]   The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by  Schocken Books  in 1948 as   The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces  ,  [201]   including additionally   The First Long Train Journey  , written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka\\'s \"A Novel about Youth\", a review of Felix Sternheim\\'s  Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald , his essay on Kleist\\'s \"Anecdotes\", his review of the literary magazine   Hyperion  , and an epilogue by Brod. ,  Later editions, notably those of 1954 (  Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings  ), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and  Ernst Kaiser ,  [202]   which had been deleted by earlier publishers.  [170]   Known as \"Definitive Editions\", they include translations of  The Trial, Definitive ,   The Castle, Definitive  , and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation.  [203]   Published in 1961 by Schocken Books,   Parables and Paradoxes   presented in a bilingual edition by  Nahum N. Glatzer  selected writings,  [204]   drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel  Der Process . ,  New translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit\\u200d—\\u200c  The Castle, Critical   by  Mark Harman  ( Schocken Books , 1998),  [168]    The Trial, Critical  by  Breon Mitchell  (Schocken Books, 1998),  [205]   and  Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared  by  Michael Hofmann  ( New Directions Publishing , 2004).  [206]   ,  Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka\\'s sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—this being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is due to the construction of  subordinate clauses in German  which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text.  [207]   German\\'s more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English.  [208]   An example is the first sentence of Kafka\\'s \"The Metamorphosis\", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:  [209]   ,    Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt  . (original) ,  As Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word-for-word translation)  [210]   ,  Another difficult problem facing translators is how to deal with the author\\'s intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely.  [211]    [212]   One such instance is found in the first sentence of  \"The Metamorphosis\" . English translators often render the word   Ungeziefer   as \"insect\"; in Middle German, however,   Ungeziefer   literally means \"an animal unclean for sacrifice\";  [213]   in today\\'s German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean \"bug\"\\xa0—a very general term, unlike the scientific \"insect\". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor\\'s disgust at his transformation.  [136]    [137]   Another example is Kafka\\'s use of the German noun    Verkehr    in the final sentence of \"Das Urteil\". Literally,   Verkehr   means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: \"At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge\".  [214]   The double meaning of  Verkehr  is given added weight by Kafka\\'s confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of \"a violent ejaculation\".  [134]    [215]   ,  Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective.  [216]   Shimon Sandbank, a professor, literary critic, and writer, identifies Kafka as having influenced  Jorge Luis Borges ,  Albert Camus ,  Eugène Ionesco ,  J. M. Coetzee  and  Jean-Paul Sartre .  [217]   A  Financial Times  literary critic credits Kafka with influencing  José Saramago ,  [218]   and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that  J. D. Salinger  loved to read Kafka\\'s works.  [219]   In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked   Der Process   and   Das Schloss   the second and ninth  most significant German-language novels of the 20th century .  [220]   Sandbank argues that despite Kafka\\'s pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated.  [217]   Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at  Binghamton University  who specialises in Kafka\\'s works, says Kafka\\'s influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture.  [221]   Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka \"has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century\".  [5]   Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the \"century of Kafka\".  [5]   ,  Michel-André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the \"irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world\".  [181]   His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka\\'s universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as  George Orwell  and  Ray Bradbury .  [181]   ,  The following are examples of works across a range of literary, musical, and dramatic genres which demonstrate the extent of cultural influence: ,  The term \"Kafkaesque\" is used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work, particularly   Der Process   (  The Trial  ) and \"Die Verwandlung\" (  The Metamorphosis  ). Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.  [5]    [223]    [240]    [241]   ,  Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction. Works in this genre that have been thus described include  Patrick Bokanowski \\'s 1982 film   The Angel  , Terry Gilliam\\'s 1985 film   Brazil  , and the 1998 science fiction  film noir ,   Dark City  . Films from other genres which have been similarly described include   The Tenant   (1976) and   Barton Fink   (1991).  [242]   The television series   The Prisoner   and   The Twilight Zone   are also frequently described as Kafkaesque.  [243]    [244]   ,  However, with common usage, the term has become so ubiquitous that Kafka scholars note it\\'s often misused.  [245]   More accurately then, according to author Ben Marcus, paraphrased in \"What it Means to be Kafkaesque\" by Joe Fassler in  The Atlantic , \"Kafka’s quintessential qualities are affecting use of language, a setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness—hopelessly and full of hope.\"   [246]   ,  The  Franz Kafka Museum  in Prague is dedicated to Kafka and his work. A major component of the museum is an exhibit  The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague , which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the  Jewish Museum  in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in  Malá Strana  (Lesser Town), along the  Moldau . The museum calls its display of original photos and documents  Město K. Franz Kafka a Praha  (City K. Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote.  [247]   ,  The  Franz Kafka Prize  is an annual literary award of the  Franz Kafka Society  and the City of Prague established in 2001. It recognizes the merits of literature as \"humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times\".  [248]   The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language.  [248]   The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in  Prague\\'s Old Town Hall  on the Czech State Holiday in late October.  [248]   ,   San Diego State University  (SDSU) operates the   Kafka Project  , which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka\\'s last writings.

       " '[  First World War  ,   John Ronald Reuel Tolkien ,   CBE ,  FRSL   (   /  ˈ  t  ɒ  l  k  iː  n  /   ;  [a]   3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet,  philologist , and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic  high-fantasy  works   The Hobbit  ,   The Lord of the Rings  , and   The Silmarillion  . ,  He served as the  Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon  and Fellow of  Pembroke College, Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and  Merton Professor of English Language and Literature  and Fellow of  Merton College, Oxford  from 1945 to 1959.  [1]   He was at one time a close friend of  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis —they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the  Inklings . Tolkien was appointed a  Commander of the Order of the British Empire  by Queen  Elizabeth II  on 28 March 1972. ,  After Tolkien\\'s death, his son  Christopher  published a series of works based on his father\\'s extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including  The Silmarillion . These, together with  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings , form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called  Arda  and  Middle-earth   [b]   within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term   legendarium   to the larger part of these writings.  [2]   ,  While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien,  [3]   the great success of  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  led directly to  a popular resurgence of the genre . This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature  [4]    [5]  —or, more precisely, of high fantasy.  [6]   In 2008,   The Times   ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".  [7]     Forbes   ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009.  [8]   ,  Tolkien\\'s paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family had emigrated from Germany in the 18th century but had become \"quickly intensely English\".  [9]   According to the family tradition, the Tolkiens had arrived in England in 1756, as refugees from  Frederick the Great \\'s invasion of the  Electorate of Saxony  during the  Seven Years\\' War .  [10]   Several families with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling live in northwestern Germany, mainly in Lower Saxony and Hamburg.  [11]    [12]   ,  Tolkien believed his surname derived from the German word  tollkühn , meaning \"foolhardy\",  [13]   and jokingly inserted himself as a \"cameo\" into   The Notion Club Papers   under the literally-translated name Rashbold. However, this origin of the name has not been proven.  [14]   A German writer has suggested that the name is more likely to derive from the village of  Tolkynen  near  Rastenburg ,  East Prussia  (now in Poland and known as Tołkiny). Although that village is far from Lower Saxony, its name is derived from the now-extinct  Old Prussian language .  [15]    [16]   ,  John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in  Bloemfontein  in the  Orange Free State  (now  Free State Province  in South Africa) to  Arthur Reuel Tolkien  (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel,  née  Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother,  Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien , who was born on 17 February 1894.  [17]   ,  As a child, he was bitten by a large  baboon spider  in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although Tolkien admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his  kraal  to show him off, returning him the next morning.  [18]   ,  When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of  rheumatic fever  before he could join them.  [19]   This left the family without an income, so Tolkien\\'s mother took him to live with her parents in  Kings Heath ,  [20]   Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to  Sarehole  (now in  Hall Green ), then a  Worcestershire  village, later annexed to Birmingham.  [21]   He enjoyed exploring  Sarehole Mill  and  Moseley Bog  and the  Clent ,  Lickey  and  Malvern Hills , which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as  Bromsgrove ,  Alcester , and  Alvechurch  and places such as his aunt Jane\\'s farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.  [22]   ,  Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.  [23]   She taught him a great deal of  botany  and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of  Latin  very early.  [24]   ,  Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked   Treasure Island   and   The Pied Piper   and thought   Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland   by  Lewis Carroll  was \"amusing but disturbing\". He liked stories about  \"Red Indians\"  (Native Americans) and the fantasy works by  George MacDonald .  [25]   In addition, the \"Fairy Books\" of  Andrew Lang  were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.  [26]   ,  Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,  [28]   which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of  acute diabetes  at Fern Cottage in  Rednal , which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with  diabetes mellitus type 1  could live without treatment— insulin  would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, \"My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.\"  [28]   ,  Prior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the  Birmingham Oratory , who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called \"Father Francis\": \"He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was  not . I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the \\'liberal\\' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [i.e. Tolkien having grown up knowing more] about \\' Bloody Mary \\' than the  Mother of Jesus —who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists.\"  [29]   ,  After his mother\\'s death, Tolkien grew up in the  Edgbaston  area of Birmingham and attended  King Edward\\'s School, Birmingham , and later  St. Philip\\'s School . In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward\\'s. While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school\\'s  Officers Training Corps  who helped \"line the route\" for the 1910  coronation  parade of King  George V . Like the other cadets from King Edward\\'s, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of  Buckingham Palace .  [30]   ,  In Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of  Perrott\\'s Folly  and the  Victorian  tower of  Edgbaston Waterworks , which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.  [31]    [32]   Another strong influence was the  romantic  medievalist paintings of  Edward Burne-Jones  and the  Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ; the  Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery  had a large collection of works on public display.  [33]   ,  While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a  constructed language , Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.  [34]    [35]   ,  Tolkien learned  Esperanto  some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears.  [36]   Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto.  [37]   ,  In 1911, while they were at King Edward\\'s School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow\\'s Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.  [38]    [39]   After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a \"council\" in London at Wiseman\\'s home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry. ,  In 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,  [30]   noting that  Bilbo \\'s journey across the  Misty Mountains  (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from  Interlaken  to  Lauterbrunnen  and on to camp in the  moraines  beyond  Mürren . Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of  Jungfrau  and  Silberhorn  (\"the Silvertine ( Celebdil ) of my dreams\"). They went across the  Kleine Scheidegg  to  Grindelwald  and on across the  Grosse Scheidegg  to  Meiringen . They continued across the  Grimsel Pass , through the upper  Valais  to  Brig  and on to the  Aletsch glacier  and  Zermatt .  [40]   ,  In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at  Exeter College, Oxford . He initially studied  Classics  but changed his course in 1913 to English Language and  Literature , graduating in 1915 with  first-class honours  in his final examinations.  [41]   ,  At the age of 16, J.R.R. Tolkien met  Edith Mary Bratt , who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road,  Edgbaston . According to Humphrey Carpenter, ,  Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.  [42]   ,  His guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien\\'s having \"muffed\" his exams and considered it \"altogether unfortunate\"  [43]   that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older,  Protestant  woman. He prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter,  [44]   with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.  [45]   ,  In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: ,  I had to choose between disobeying and grieving (or deceiving) a guardian who had been a father to me, more than most fathers ... and \"dropping\" the love-affair until I was 21. I don\\'t regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly  three  years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.  [43]   ,  On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at  Cheltenham . He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien\\'s letter, everything had changed. ,  On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien\\'s proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".  [46]   Upon learning of Edith\\'s new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"  [47]   ,  Following their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien\\'s insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly  anti-Catholic \", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.  [48]   ,  Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at  St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick , on 22 March 1916.  [49]   In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife\\'s willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.  [43]   ,  In August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the  First World War . Tolkien\\'s relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the  British Army . In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"  [43]   ,  Instead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",  [43]   and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".  [43]   He was then commissioned as a temporary  second lieutenant  in the  Lancashire Fusiliers  on 15 July 1915.  [50]    [51]   He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on  Cannock Chase ,  Staffordshire , for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"  [52]   Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp. ,  On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to  Folkestone  for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough &amp; Harrow Hotel in Birmingham. ,  He later wrote, \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then\\xa0... it was like a death.\"  [53]   ,  On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to  Calais . Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the  British Expeditionary Force \\'s (BEF) base depot at  Étaples . On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the  74th Brigade ,  25th Division . ,  While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled,  The Lonely Isle , which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army\\'s  postal censorship , he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.  [54]   ,  He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at  Rubempré , near  Amiens .  [55]   He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.  [56]   According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol forbade him from developing friendships with \" other ranks \". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"  [57]   ,  Tolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"  [57]   ,  Tolkien arrived at the  Somme  in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at  Bouzincourt , he participated in the assaults on the  Schwaben Redoubt  and the  Leipzig Salient . According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers,  Anglican  chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers: ,  On one occasion I spent the night with the Brigade Machine Gun Officer and the Signals Officer in one of the captured German dugouts ... We dossed down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep, but it was not to be. We no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up. So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of   hors d\\'oeuvre   and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.  [58]   ,  Tolkien\\'s time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband\\'s death. To get around the  British Army \\'s  postal censorship , the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband\\'s movements on a map of the  Western Front . ,  On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked  Regina Trench , Tolkien came down with  trench fever , a disease carried by  lice , which were common in the dugouts. Tolkien was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.  [59]   Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the  first day of the Somme  while leading his men in the assault on  Beaumont Hamel . Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien\\'s battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England. ,  Tolkien might well have been killed himself, but he had suffered from health problems and had been removed from combat multiple times.  [60]   ,  According to John Garth: ,  Although  Kitchener \\'s  army  enshrined old social boundaries, it also chipped away at the class divide by throwing men from all walks of life into a desperate situation together. Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, \\'a deep sympathy and feeling for the  Tommy ; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties\\'. He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.  [61]   ,  In later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the  Second World War  were entirely mistaken: ,  One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.  [62]   ,  A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.  [63]    [64]   ,  During his recovery in a cottage in  Little Haywood ,  Staffordshire , he began to work on what he called   The Book of Lost Tales  , beginning with   The Fall of Gondolin  .  Lost Tales  represented Tolkien\\'s attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing.  [65]   Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great  U-Boat campaign ) round about the  Battle of Cambrai , when then end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\".  [43]   ,  Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918.  [66]   When he was stationed at  Kingston upon Hull , he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby  Roos , and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife\\'s death in 1971, Tolkien remembered, ,  I never called Edith  Luthien —but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the  Silmarillion . It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks  [67]   at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing—and  dance . But the story has gone crooked, &amp; I am left, and  I  cannot plead before the inexorable  Mandos .  [68]   ,  This incident inspired the account of the meeting of  Beren and Lúthien .  [69]   ,  On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.  [70]   His first civilian job after World War I was at the   Oxford English Dictionary  , where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter  W .  [71]   In 1920, he took up a post as  Reader  in English Language at the  University of Leeds , and became the youngest professor there.  [72]   While at Leeds, he produced  A Middle English Vocabulary  and a definitive edition of   Sir Gawain and the Green Knight   with  E. V. Gordon , both becoming academic standard works for several decades. He also translated  Sir Gawain ,   Pearl  , and   Sir Orfeo  . In 1925, he returned to Oxford as  Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon , with a fellowship at  Pembroke College . ,  During his time at  Pembroke College  Tolkien wrote   The Hobbit   and the first two volumes of  The Lord of the Rings , whilst living at 20  Northmoor Road  in  North Oxford  (where a  blue plaque  was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name \" Nodens \", following Sir  Mortimer Wheeler \\'s unearthing of a  Roman   Asclepeion  at  Lydney Park , Gloucestershire, in 1928.  [73]   ,  In the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of   Beowulf  , which he finished in 1926. He never published it. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than forty years after Tolkien\\'s death and almost 90 years since its completion.  [74]   ,  Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, entitled \" Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics \", which had a lasting influence on  Beowulf  research.  [75]   Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about  Beowulf  is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.  [76]   At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated  Beowulf  for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of  Beowulf  was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.  [77]   Where  Beowulf  does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at  Finnsburg , Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.  [78]   In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: \"Beowulf is among my most valued sources\", and this influence may be seen throughout his  Middle-earth   legendarium .  [79]   ,  According to  Humphrey Carpenter , Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on  Beowulf : ,  He would come silently into the room, fix the audience with his gaze, and suddenly begin to declaim in a resounding voice the opening lines of the poem in the original Anglo-Saxon, commencing with a great cry of   Hwæt !  (The first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be \"Quiet!\" It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that  Beowulf  was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry.  [80]   ,  Decades later,  W.H. Auden  wrote to his former professor, ,  I don\\'t think that I have ever told you what an unforgettable experience it was for me as an undergraduate, hearing you recite  Beowulf . The voice was the voice of  Gandalf .  [80]   ,  In the run-up to the  Second World War , Tolkien was earmarked as a  codebreaker .  [81]    [82]   In January 1939, he was asked whether he would be prepared to serve in the  cryptographic  department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency.  [81]    [82]   He replied in the affirmative and, beginning on 27 March, took an instructional course at the London HQ of the  Government Code and Cypher School .  [81]    [82]   A record of his training was found which included the notation \"keen\" next to his name,  [83]   although Tolkien scholar Anders Stenström suggested that \"In all likelihood, that is not a record of Tolkien\\'s interest, but a note about how to pronounce the name.\"  [84]   He was informed in October that his services would not be required.  [81]    [82]   ,  In 1945, Tolkien moved to  Merton College, Oxford , becoming the  Merton Professor of English Language and Literature ,  [85]   in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for  University College, Dublin , for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the  National University of Ireland  (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed  The Lord of the Rings  in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches. ,  Tolkien also translated the  Book of Jonah  for the   Jerusalem Bible  , which was published in 1966.  [86]   ,  The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984),  Christopher John Reuel Tolkien  (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated  letters from Father Christmas  when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas\\'s helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas\\'s battles against  goblins  who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.  [87]   ,  During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend  C. S. Lewis  even nominated him for the  Nobel Prize in Literature .  [88]   The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.  [24]   At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers\\' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement.  [89]   In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a  cult-figure , but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\"  [90]   ,  Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,  [91]   and eventually he and Edith moved to  Bournemouth , which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien\\'s status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow  Inklings . Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place. ,  According to  Humphrey Carpenter : ,  Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other\\'s health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other\\'s birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage. They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.  [92]   ,  Edith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. According to  Simon Tolkien : ,  My grandmother died two years before my grandfather and he came back to live in Oxford.  Merton College  gave him rooms just off the High Street. I went there frequently and he\\'d take me to lunch in the Eastgate Hotel. Those lunches were rather wonderful for a 12-year-old boy spending time with his grandfather, but sometimes he seemed sad. There was one visit when he told me how much he missed my grandmother. It must have been very strange for him being alone after they had been married for more than 50 years.  [93]   ,  Tolkien was appointed by  Queen Elizabeth II  a Commander of the  Order of the British Empire  in the  1972 New Year Honours   [94]   and received the insignia of the Order at  Buckingham Palace  on 28 March 1972.  [95]   In the same year Oxford University conferred upon him an honorary  Doctorate of Letters .  [41]    [96]   ,  Tolkien had the name  Lúthien  engraved on Edith\\'s tombstone at  Wolvercote Cemetery ,  Oxford . When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973, at the age of 81,  [97]   he was buried in the same grave, with  Beren  added to his name. The engravings read: ,  In Tolkien\\'s  Middle-earth   legendarium , Lúthien was the most beautiful of all the  Children of Ilúvatar , and forsook her  immortality  for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the  Dark Lord   Morgoth , Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking  wolfhound   Huan . Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf  Carcharoth , Lúthien, like  Orpheus , approached the  Valar , the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life. ,  Tolkien was a devout  Roman Catholic , and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with  libertarian ,  Distributist , and  monarchist  leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, \"My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy ( philosophically understood , meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)—or to \\'unconstitutional\\'  Monarchy .\"  [98]   ,  Although he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the  British Empire  and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d\\'Ardenne, he wrote, \"The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the  Tweed  and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when  Hitler  (or a Frenchman) says \\'Germany (or France) must live forever\\' we know that he lies.\"  [99]   ,  Tolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and  simpler life . For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle.  [100]   This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced \"industrialization\" of the  Shire  in  The Lord of the Rings .  [101]   ,  Many commentators  [102]   have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien\\'s lifetime.  The Lord of the Rings  is often thought to represent England during and immediately after World War \\xa0 II. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.  [102]   This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \" On Fairy-Stories \", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in  The Lord of the Rings . Tolkien objected strongly to C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis\\'s use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.  [103]   However, Tolkien wrote that the  Mount Doom  scene exemplified lines from the  Lord\\'s Prayer .  [104]    [105]   ,  His love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed  mythology  to be the divine echo of \"the Truth\".  [106]   This view was expressed in his poem and essay entitled   Mythopoeia  .  [107]   His theory that myths held \"fundamental truths\" became a central theme of the Inklings in general. ,  Tolkien\\'s devout Roman Catholic faith was a significant factor in the conversion of  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis  from  atheism  to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the  Church of England .  [108]   ,  According to his grandson  Simon Tolkien , Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the  liturgical  reforms and changes implemented after the  Second Vatican Council : ,  I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn\\'t agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.  [93]   ,  Tolkien voiced support for the  Nationalists  (eventually led by  Franco  during the  Spanish Civil War ) upon hearing that communist  Republicans  were destroying churches and  killing priests and nuns .  [109]   ,  Tolkien was contemptuous of  Joseph Stalin . During World War \\xa0 II, Tolkien referred to Stalin as \"that bloodthirsty old murderer\".  [110]   However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that  The Lord of the Rings  was an  anti-communist   parable  and identified  Sauron  with Stalin. Tolkien said, \"I utterly repudiate any such  reading , which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the  Russian revolution . Such  allegory  is entirely foreign to my thought.\"  [111]   ,  Christine Chism  [112]   distinguishes  racist  or  racialist  elements in Tolkien\\'s views and works as falling into three categories: intentional racism,  [113]   unconscious  Eurocentric  bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien\\'s early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies in his late work. ,  Tolkien once wrote of  racial segregation  in South Africa, \"The treatment of colour nearly always horrifies anyone going out from Britain.\"  [114]   ,  Tolkien vocally opposed  Adolf Hitler  and the  Nazi Party  prior to the  Second World War , and was known to especially despise  Nazi  racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening Verlag was preparing to release  The Hobbit  in  Nazi Germany . To Tolkien\\'s outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of  Aryan  origin. In a letter to his British publisher  Stanley Unwin , he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many  Jewish  friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\".  [115]   He provided two letters to Rütten &amp; Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \" Aryan \" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of  Indo-Iranian languages . He continued, ,  But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of  Jewish  origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have  no  ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject—which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.  [116]   ,  In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in \"Nordicism\": ,  You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil. But no one ever calls on me to \"broadcast\" or do a postscript. Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this \"Nordic\" nonsense. Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.  [117]   ,  In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as \" Nordic \", a term he said he disliked because of its association with  racialist theories .  [118]   ,  Tolkien criticized Allied use of  total war  tactics against civilians from  Nazi Germany  and  Imperial Japan . In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote: ,  We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,—you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter—leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.  [119]   ,  He also reacted with anger at the excesses of  anti-German  propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher: ,  ...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don\\'t know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.  [120]   ,  He was horrified by the  atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , referring to the scientists of the  Manhattan Project  as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \" Babel -builders\".  [121]   ,  During most of his own life conservationism wasn\\'t yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of  The Lord of the Rings , Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.  [122]    [123]    [124]   ,  Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his   legendarium  , beginning with   The Book of Lost Tales  , written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during  The Battle of the Somme . The two most prominent stories, the tale of  Beren and Lúthien  and that of  Túrin , were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in   The Lays of Beleriand  ). ,  One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the  Arts and Crafts   polymath   William Morris . Tolkien wished to imitate Morris\\'s prose and poetry romances,  [125]   from which he took hints for the names of features such as the  Dead Marshes  in  The Lord of the Rings   [126]   and  Mirkwood ,  [127]   along with some general aspects of approach. ,   Edward Wyke-Smith \\'s  The Marvellous Land of Snergs , with its \"table-high\" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo\\'s race in  The Hobbit .  [128]   ,  Tolkien also cited  H. Rider Haggard \\'s novel   She   in a telephone interview: \"I suppose as a boy  She  interested me as much as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving.\"  [129]   A supposed facsimile of this  potsherd  appeared in Haggard\\'s first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She\\'s ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the  Testament of  Isildur   in  The Lord of the Rings   [130]   and to Tolkien\\'s efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the   Book of Mazarbul  .  [131]   Critics starting with  Edwin Muir   [132]   have found resemblances between Haggard\\'s romances and Tolkien\\'s.  [133]    [134]    [135]   ,  Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by  S. R. Crockett \\'s historical novel  The Black Douglas  and of basing the Necromancer ( Sauron ) on its villain,  Gilles de Retz .  [136]   Incidents in both  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  are similar in narrative and style to the novel,  [137]   and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien.  [138]   ,  Tolkien was inspired by early  Germanic , especially  Old English , literature,  poetry , and  mythology , which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included  Old English literature  such as   Beowulf  ,  Norse sagas  such as the   Volsunga saga   and the   Hervarar saga  ,  [139]   the   Poetic Edda  , the   Prose Edda  , the   Nibelungenlied  , and numerous other culturally related works.  [140]   Despite the similarities of his work to the  Volsunga saga  and the  Nibelungenlied , which were the basis for  Richard Wagner \\'s opera cycle   Der Ring des Nibelungen  , Tolkien dismissed critics\\' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, \"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\" However, some critics  [141]    [142]    [143]   believe that Tolkien was, in fact, indebted to Wagner for elements such as the \"concept of the Ring as giving the owner mastery of the world ...\"  [144]   Two of the characteristics possessed by the  One Ring , its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills, were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner\\'s opera. ,  Tolkien also acknowledged several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas.  Sophocles \\' play   Oedipus Rex   he cited as inspiring elements of   The Silmarillion   and   The Children of Húrin  . In addition, Tolkien first read  William Forsell Kirby \\'s translation of the Finnish  national epic , the   Kalevala  , while attending King Edward\\'s School. He described its character of  Väinämöinen  as one of his influences for  Gandalf the Grey . The  Kalevala\\' s  antihero   Kullervo  was further described as an inspiration for  Túrin Turambar .  [145]    Dimitra Fimi ,  Douglas A. Anderson , John Garth, and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of  Celtic  ( Irish ,  Scottish  and  Welsh ) history and legends.  [146]    [147]   However, after the  Silmarillion  manuscript was rejected, in part for its \"eye-splitting\" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin: ,  Needless to say they are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason. They have bright colour, but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design. They are in fact \"mad\" as your reader says—but I don\\'t believe I am.  [148]    [149]   ,  Catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien\\'s creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.  [140]    [150]   Tolkien acknowledged this himself: ,   The Lord of the Rings  is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like \\'religion\\', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.  [151]   ,  Specifically,  Paul H. Kocher  argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the  absence of good . He cites many examples in  The Lord of the Rings , such as Sauron\\'s \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien\\'s source as  Thomas Aquinas , \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\".  [152]    Tom Shippey  makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with  Alfred the Great \\'s Anglo-Saxon translation of  Boethius \\'   Consolation of Philosophy  , known as the   Lays of Boethius  . Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of  Frodo \\'s remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by  Treebeard  and  Elrond .  [153]   He goes on to argue that in  The Lord of the Rings  evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the  Manichaean heresy ), and suggests that Alfred\\'s additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.  [154]   ,  Another interesting argument is Stratford Caldecott\\'s theological view on the Ring and what it represents. \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly \"thin\" and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run\".  [155]   ,  As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic   Beowulf   by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day.  Beowulf  is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien\\'s later fiction, with major details of both  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of  Beowulf  which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem: ,  As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.  [156]   ,  In addition to his  mythopoeic  compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.  [157]   He wrote annual Christmas letters from  Father Christmas  for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as   The Father Christmas Letters  ). Other stories included   Mr. Bliss   and   Roverandom   (for children), and   Leaf by Niggle   (part of   Tree and Leaf  ),   The Adventures of Tom Bombadil  ,   On Fairy-Stories  ,   Smith of Wootton Major   and   Farmer Giles of Ham  .  Roverandom  and  Smith of Wootton Major , like  The Hobbit , borrowed ideas from his  legendarium . ,  Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called   The Hobbit  , which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm  George Allen &amp; Unwin , who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.  [97]   However, when it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel. ,  The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel   The Lord of the Rings   (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for  The Lord of the Rings , during which time he received the constant support of the  Inklings , in particular his closest friend  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis , the author of   The Chronicles of Narnia  . Both  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  are set against the background of  The Silmarillion , but in a time long after it. ,  Tolkien at first intended  The Lord of the Rings  to be a children\\'s tale in the style of  The Hobbit , but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.  [158]   Though a direct sequel to  The Hobbit , it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense  backstory  of  Beleriand  that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in  The Silmarillion  and other volumes. Tolkien\\'s influence weighs heavily on the  fantasy  genre that grew up after the success of  The Lord of the Rings . ,   The Lord of the Rings  became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.  [159]   In the 2003 \" Big Read \" survey conducted by the BBC,  The Lord of the Rings  was found to be the UK\\'s \"Best-loved Novel\".  [160]   Australians voted  The Lord of the Rings  \"My Favourite Book\" in a 2004 survey conducted by the  Australian ABC .  [161]   In a 1999 poll of  Amazon.com  customers,  The Lord of the Rings  was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\".  [162]   In 2002 Tolkien was voted the 92nd \" greatest Briton \" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 he was voted 35th in the  SABC3\\'s Great South Africans , the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is not limited to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK\\'s \"Big Read\" survey, about 250,000 Germans found  The Lord of the Rings  to be their favourite work of literature.  [163]   ,  Tolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the   Quenta Silmarillion  , an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with  The Lord of the Rings , but publishers (both  Allen &amp; Unwin  and  Collins ) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring  The Lord of the Rings  to be published in three volumes.  [164]   The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series   The History of Middle-earth  , edited by Tolkien\\'s son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of  The Fall of  Númenor  , which was inspired by the legend of  Atlantis . ,  Tolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his  literary executor , and he (with assistance from  Guy Gavriel Kay , later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as   The Silmarillion   in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.  [165]   ,  In 1980 Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title   Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth  . In subsequent years (1983–1996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called   The History of Middle-earth  . They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between  The Lord of the Rings  and  The Hobbit , the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing  The Hobbit  for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.  [166]   ,  One of Tolkien\\'s least-known short works is the children\\'s  storybook    Mr. Bliss  , published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien\\'s own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien\\'s sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of  The Hobbit . The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien\\'s difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page. ,  More recently, in 2007,   The Children of Húrin   was published by  HarperCollins  (in the UK and Canada) and  Houghton Mifflin  (in the US). The novel tells the story of  Túrin Turambar  and his sister  Nienor , children of  Húrin Thalion . The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from  The Silmarillion ,   Unfinished Tales  ,   The History of Middle-earth  , and unpublished manuscripts. ,    The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún  , which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of  Sigurd  and the fall of the  Niflungs  from Germanic mythology. It is a  narrative poem  composed in  alliterative verse  and is modelled after the  Old Norse  poetry of the  Elder Edda . Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father\\'s work. ,  According to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work\\'s composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\"  [167]   In a 1967 letter to  W. H. Auden , Tolkien wrote, ,  Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganizing   The Song of the Sibyl  . In return again I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn\\'t lost), a thing I did many years ago when trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the Völsungs from the Elder Edda, written in the old eight-line  fornyrðislag  stanza.  [168]   ,    The Fall of Arthur  , published on 23 May 2013, is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early-1930s. It is  alliterative , extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the  Old English    Beowulf   metre in Modern English. Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman  Migration Period , both in form (using  Germanic verse ) and in content, showing Arthur as a  British   warlord  fighting the  Saxon invasion , while it avoids the high medieval aspects Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the  Saxon lands  ( Arthur eastward in arms purposed ).  [169]   ,    Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary  , published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem   Beowulf   from  Old English  to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher. The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien\\'s acclaimed 1936 lecture \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\".  [170]   The book also includes the previously unpublished \"Sellic Spell\" and two versions of \"The Lay of Beowulf\". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf\\'s biographical background, while the latter is a poem on the Beowulf theme.  [171]   ,    The Story of Kullervo  , first published in   Tolkien Studies   in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015, is a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem. It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford.  [172]   ,    The Tale of Beren and Lúthien   is one of the oldest and most often revised in Tolkien\\'s legendarium. The story is one of three contained within  The Silmarillion  which Tolkien believed to warrant their own long-form narratives. It was published as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, under the title  Beren and Lúthien  in 2017.  [173]   ,  Before his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including  The Lord of the Rings ,  The Hobbit  and  Farmer Giles of Ham —to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at  Marquette University \\'s John P. Raynor, S.J., Library in  Milwaukee , Wisconsin.  [174]   After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien\\'s  Silmarillion  mythology and his academic work to  Oxford University \\'s  Bodleian Library .  [175]   ,  In 2009, a partial draft of   Language and Human Nature  , which Tolkien had begun co-writing with  C.\\xa0S.\\xa0Lewis  but had never completed, was discovered at the Bodleian Library.  [176]   ,  Both Tolkien\\'s academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and  philology . He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with  Old Norse  as special subject. He worked for the  Oxford English Dictionary  from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including  walrus , over which he struggled mightily.  [177]   In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the  University of Leeds , where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of  linguistics  from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English  heroic verse ,  history of English , various  Old English  and  Middle English  texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory  Germanic  philology,  Gothic ,  Old Icelandic , and  Medieval Welsh . When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at  Pembroke College, Oxford , he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \" Viking Club \".  [178]   He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.  [179]   ,  Privately, Tolkien was attracted to \"things of  racial  and linguistic significance\", and in his 1955 lecture   English and Welsh  , which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of \"inherent linguistic predilections\", which he termed the \"native language\" as opposed to the \"cradle-tongue\" which a person first learns to speak.  [180]   He considered the  West Midlands  dialect of Middle English to be his own \"native language\", and, as he wrote to  W. H. Auden  in 1955, \"I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).\"  [181]   ,  Parallel to Tolkien\\'s professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for  constructing languages . The most developed of these are  Quenya  and  Sindarin , the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien\\'s  legendarium . Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of  aesthetics  and  euphony , and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.  [149]   A notable addition came in late 1945 with  Adûnaic  or  Númenórean , a language of a \"faintly  Semitic  flavour\", connected with Tolkien\\'s  Atlantis  legend, which by   The Notion Club Papers   ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \" Second Age \" and the story of  Eärendil  was grounded in the  legendarium , thereby providing a link of Tolkien\\'s 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth. ,  Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of  auxiliary languages : in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture   A Secret Vice  , \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \" Volapük ,  Esperanto ,  Ido ,  Novial , &amp;c, &amp;c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".  [182]   ,  The popularity of Tolkien\\'s books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien\\'s idiosyncratic spellings  dwarves  and  dwarvish  (alongside  dwarfs  and  dwarfish ), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the  Old English  plural survived, it would have been  dwarrows  or  dwerrows .) He also coined the term   eucatastrophe  , though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work. ,  In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \"[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\".  [183]   The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien\\'s legends. Personally known to him were  Pauline Baynes  (Tolkien\\'s favourite illustrator of   The Adventures of Tom Bombadil   and   Farmer Giles of Ham  ) and  Donald Swann  (who set the music to   The Road Goes Ever On  ). Queen  Margrethe II of Denmark  created illustrations to  The Lord of the Rings  in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.  [184]   ,  However, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of  The Hobbit  as \"too  Disnified  ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and  Gandalf  as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the  Odinic  wanderer that I think of\".  [185]   ,  Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging  Tolkien fandom  in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of  The Lord of the Rings : ,  Thank you for sending me the projected \\'blurbs\\', which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.  [149]   ,  He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \" On Fairy-Stories \", first presented in 1939: ,  In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ... Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy. Fantasy, even of the simplest kind, hardly ever succeeds in Drama, when that is presented as it should be, visibly and audibly acted.  [186]   ,  Tolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word  Tollywood , a portmanteau derived from \"Tolkien Hollywood\", to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in  Tolkien\\'s legendarium  aimed at generating good  box office  results, rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original.  [187]   ,  On receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of  The Lord of the Rings  by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote: ,  I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about.  [188]   ,  Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene (\"yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings\"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  to  United Artists  in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director  John Boorman  was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to  Tolkien Enterprises , a division of the  Saul Zaentz  Company, and the first film adaptation of   The Lord of the Rings   was released in 1978 as an animated  rotoscoping  film directed by  Ralph Bakshi  with screenplay by the fantasy writer  Peter S. Beagle . It covered only the first half of the story of  The Lord of the Rings .  [189]   In 1977, an  animated   musical   television film  of   The Hobbit   was made by  Rankin-Bass , and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film   The Return of the King  , which covered some of the portions of  The Lord of the Rings  that Bakshi was unable to complete. ,  From 2001 to 2003,  New Line Cinema  released   The Lord of the Rings   as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by  Peter Jackson . The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous  Oscars .  [190]   ,  From 2012 to 2014,  Warner Bros.  and  New Line Cinema  released   The Hobbit  , a series of three films based on  The Hobbit , with  Peter Jackson  serving as executive producer, director, and co-writer.  [191]   The first instalment,   The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  , was released in December 2012;  [192]   the second,   The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug  , in December 2013;  [193]   and the last instalment,   The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies  , in December 2014.  [194]   ,  Tolkien and the characters and places from his works have become the namesake of various things around the World. These include street names, mountains, companies, species of animals and plants as well as other notable objects. ,  By convention, certain classes of features on Saturn\\'s moon  Titan  are named after elements from Middle-earth.  [195]     Colles   (small hills or knobs) are named for characters,  [196]   while   montes   (mountains) are named for mountains of Middle-earth.  [197]   There are also  asteroids  named for  Bilbo Baggins  and Tolkien himself.  [198]    [199]   ,  Three mountains in the  Cadwallader Range  of  British Columbia , Canada, have been named after Tolkien\\'s characters. These are Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn.  [200]    [201]   On 1 December 2012, it was announced in the New Zealand press that a bid was launched for the  New Zealand Geographic Board  to name a mountain peak near  Milford Sound  after Tolkien for historical and literary reasons and to mark Tolkien\\'s 121st birthday.  [202]   ,  The \"Tolkien Road\" in  Eastbourne , East Sussex, was named after Tolkien whereas the \"Tolkien Way\" in  Stoke-on-Trent  is named after Tolkien\\'s eldest son, Fr. John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains.  [203]   In the  Hall Green  and  Moseley  areas of  Birmingham  there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien—most notably, the Millstream Way and  Moseley Bog .  [204]   Collectively the parks are known as the Shire Country Parks.  [204]   Also in  Weston-super-Mare , Somerset, England there are a collection of roads in the \\'Weston Village\\' named after locales of Middle Earth, namely Hobbiton Road, Bree Close, Arnor Close, Rivendell, Westmarch Way and Buckland Green. ,  In the Dutch town of  Geldrop , near  Eindhoven , the streets of an entire new neighbourhood are named after Tolkien himself (\"Laan van Tolkien\") and some of the best-known characters from his books. ,  In the Silicon Valley towns of  Saratoga  and  San Jose  in California, there are two housing developments with street names drawn from Tolkien\\'s works. About a dozen Tolkien-derived street names also appear scattered throughout the town of  Lake Forest, California . The  Columbia , Maryland, neighbourhood of Hobbit\\'s Glen and its street names (including  Rivendell  Lane, Tooks Way, and Oakenshield Circle) come from Tolkien\\'s works.  [205]   ,  In the field of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given scientific names honouring, or deriving from, characters or other fictional elements from   The Lord of the Rings  ,   The Hobbit  , and other works set in  Middle-earth .  [206]   Several taxa have been named after the character  Gollum  (also known as Sméagol), as well as for various  hobbits , the small humanlike creatures such as  Bilbo  and  Frodo Baggins . Various  elves ,  dwarves , and other creatures that appear in his writings as well as Tolkien himself have been honoured in the names of several species, including the amphipod   Leucothoe tolkieni  , and the wasp   Shireplitis tolkieni  . In 2004, the extinct hominid   Homo floresiensis   was described, and quickly earned the nickname \"hobbit\" due to its small size.  [207]   In 1978, Paleontologist  Leigh Van Valen  named over 20 taxa of extinct mammals after Tolkien lore in a single paper.  [208]    [209]   In 1999, entomologist Lauri Kaila described 48 new species of   Elachista   moths and named 37 of them after Tolkien mythology.  [206]    [210]   It has been noted that \"Tolkien has been accorded formal taxonomic commemoration like no other author.\"  [211]   ,  Since 2003  The Tolkien Society  has organized  Tolkien Reading Day , which takes place on 25 March in schools around the world.  [212]   ,  There are seven  blue plaques  in England that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham and one in Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote  The Hobbit  and most of  The Lord of the Rings . ,  Another two plaques marking buildings associated with Tolkien are:- ,  In 2012, Tolkien was among the  British cultural icons  selected by artist Sir  Peter Blake  to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles\\'   Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band   album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.  [221]    [222]   ,  Unlike other authors of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of  The Hobbit  from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien\\'s private library.  [223]   ,  A small selection of books about Tolkien and his works: ,    ]']"
